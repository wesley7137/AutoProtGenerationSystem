We report a model for hyperthermia therapies based on heat diffusion in a biological tissue containing a
topological defect. Biological tissues behave like active liquid crystals with the presence of topological defects
which are likely to anchor tumors during the metastatic phase of cancer evolution and the therapy challenge
is to destroy the cancer cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissues. The defect creates an effective
non-Euclidean geometry for low-energy excitations, modifying the bio-heat equation. Applications to protocols
of thermal ablation for various biological tissues (liver, prostate, and skin) is analyzed and discussed.

1. The context
In essence, cancer consists of an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that invade healthy
neighboring body parts. Despite important breakthroughs in the understanding, diagnosis, and
treatment of the various forms of cancer, it is still the second leading cause of mortality worldwide
[1]. This incentivizes the development of new tools to supplement chemotherapies and radiothera-
pies, such as image-guided thermal tumor ablation [2, 3].
Hyperthermia treatments must obey two constraints: on the one hand, they have to destroy the
cancer cells without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue [3], and on the other hand, thermal
ablation must be performed completely, otherwise the heating of the tumor cells may promote
increased tolerance concerning elevated temperatures and even trigger accelerated cancer cells
growth [4]. Hence, the efficiency of thermal ablation protocols requires 1) a thorough understanding
of heat diffusion processes in the vicinity of cancer cells and 2) a precise account of the deposited
energy, a delicate tuning between the temperature reached and the duration of the treatment.
A possible track to fulfil requirement 1) is to track down topological defects. For the physicist,
the notion of topological defect is ubiquitous (phase transitions, cosmology, high energy physics,
solid state, liquid crystals, etc [5]), but that it could be of probable interest in oncology is like
a surprise at first glance. The presence of topological defects in biological tissues is now well-
established and their possible role in biological processes soon attracted the attention of physicists
[6], but it is only recently that studies have shown how this role may also be central in certain
kinds of cancer. Indeed, body organs are covered in the surface by the epithelium, which behaves
as an active liquid crystal: the epithelial cells display an orientational order within domains, and at
the boundaries between competing domains, topological defects arise [7–9]. During the metastatic

phase of cancer evolution, cancer cells concentrate in the vicinity of topological defects due to lower
cell density in the core region [10, 11], which makes them attractive targets for thermal therapies.
In addition to the vast body of available data, hyperthermia may highly benefit from a predic-
tive mathematical model to optimize treatment strategies. Although cancers are convoluted and
multifactorial diseases, such highly complex behaviors may often be captured by a set of elemen-
tary physical mechanisms: this is the framework of mathematical oncology, which has become -
although not without some difficulty - a compulsory tool to enable cancer discoveries [12–15]. In
this work, we report a differential geometry-based model designed to characterize and discriminate
thermotherapy protocols in oncology. This may have some relevance for image-guided interven-
tional therapies. We solve numerically Pennes’ bioheat equation in a biological tissue displaying
a topological defect. The heat balance encompasses the influence of the metabolism and blood
flow [16–18], along with the energy input due to the thermal treatment. The defect is included
by writing the diffusion equation on a curved manifold [19], since defects induce non-Euclidean
geometries for propagating low-energy excitations [20, 21]. Depending on the physical properties of
the biological tissue where a tumor is supposed to be present (for instance liver, skin, prostate...),
we can thus estimate, in the form of a compromise between the temperature to be applied and the
duration of application, the scenario that seems the most appropriate.
In this preliminary study, we aim to show that the Physics of topological defects and heat
transport in the presence of such defects may have something meaningful to say in the very practical
field of cancer therapies but the model proposed here has strong limitations: i) It is a continuum field
theory approach (here in cylindrical symmetry), a coarse-grained description at scales much larger
than the cells sizes. ii) The physical parameters describing the tissues are taken from the literature
and supposed to be fixed, i.e. their temperature dependence is neglected. This does not account for
the possible response of the organism to the elevation of temperature. iii) The mechanisms of cell
death are complex biological processes, which are here (over-)simplified, considering that after a
period determined by the imposed temperature, the cells are killed and that this does not depend
on the type of tissue considered. All these aspects should be analyzed in deeper detail to ensure a
better validity of the model. These aspects are discussed in the conclusion.
The paper is structured as follows. First, we describe at a very introductory level recent ob-
servations made in medicine and biology – to be specific we will refer later to the case of ovarian,
liver, prostate, and skin cancers, but the observations are of a wider range of applications. We
then propose a physical description of a model system that we believe is reasonably close to the
experimental situation considered and present the tenets of heat diffusion on non-Euclidean geome-
tries. We finally performed several case studies to determine which hyperthermia protocol seems
more efficient for maintaining the core of the defect at high temperatures while preserving the
surrounding tissues.
2. Topological defects in biological tissues drive tumors location during the
metastatic cascade
Here we summarize the present knowledge on the role of topological defects in biological tissues
on the mechanisms of pinning and growth of metastases since this will be the building block of
our later analysis. A crucial phase in the development of many cancers is indeed the metastasis
formation: cancer cells spread from the primary tumor and colonize distant secondary organs. To
do so, cancer cells must successfully go through a series of steps (the metastatic cascade [22]):
the cells must detach from a primary tumor ( extrusion ) and invade the surrounding tissue (this is
called EMT , see the glossary at the end of the paper) [23], then enter a blood or lymphatic vessel
(intravasion ) where they circulate to reach distant organs. There, the cancer cells exit the vessel
(extravasion ), and grow in a new tissue. This is the metastatic growth. During all these steps, the
tumor cells encounter immune cells to which they must be resistant.
The Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and the Transcriptional Co-activator with PDZ-binding
Motif (TAZ) are regulators of early embryonic development and the growth of tissues. While they
are not direct drivers of cancer, they have been implicated in cancer development and progression
?????-2Differential geometry, a possible avenue for thermal ablation in oncology?2
due to their involvement in various cellular processes. They drive the transcription of genes that
promote cell proliferation, cell survival, and stem cell maintenance [24, 25]. In vitro and in vivo
evidence (in particular with human cell lines) suggest that inappropriate YAP or TAZ activation
can promote metastasis by influencing virtually every process of the aforementioned cascade. In
particular, the authors of Ref. [24] write:
“a meta-analysis of 21 different studies with a combined 2983 patients revealed
that YAP is overexpressed and associated with poor outcomes and reduced survival in
many human cancers. This is complemented by numerous in vivo studies that show a
role for YAP or TAZ in tumor formation and growth” (. . . ) “Several other [studies]
have directly implicated YAP, TAZ, or TEADs in metastasis of numerous cancer types,
including melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, gastric cancer,
ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and oral squamous cell carcinoma.”
Those studies show that overexpression of YAP or TAZ enhances the morphological changes asso-
ciated with EMT and promotes cell migration and invasion of mesothelioma . A few studies have
also implicated YAP in the intravasion in blood vessels and suggested that YAP and TAZ enhance
tumor cell survival in circulation. Cancer cells with high YAP/TAZ activity show resistance to
anoikis (cell’s death) since YAP/TAZ activity in tumor cells also helps these cells to evade the im-
mune system, which is a critical step for proliferation, tumor progression, and metastasis. Authors
of Ref. [24] conclude that
“experimental evidence (. . . ) suggests that YAP/TAZ activation, which occurs in
many human cancer types, is pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic”.
Epithelial and mesothelial tissues are typically organized in a highly ordered and regular man-
ner, with cells tightly packed and adhering to one another to form continuous sheets. However,
under certain conditions or during specific developmental processes, topological defects or devia-
tions from perfect regularity can occur in these tissues. Many aggressive cancer cells already have
elevated YAP/TAZ activity before they enter circulation, but being exposed to shear stress or
disturbed flow induced by the presence of topological defects further activates YAP and TAZ. If
the mechanisms leading to defect formation in biological tissues are not fully understood, correla-
tions have been identified between collagen density and tumorigenesis. Tumor-associated collagen
signatures (TACS) are used for the identification of pre-palpable tumors in tissues rich in collagen.
Authors of Ref. [26] showed that for TACS-2 tumors (non-invasive), collagen fibers are stretched
parallelwise to the tumor regular boundary, forming a nest around it, whereas for TACS-3 tumors
(invasive), collagen fibers align normally to tumor irregular boundary: one may therefore expect
that such orientational transition left relics in the form of defects that may promote the local
invasion ought to migration of epithelial cells. In different epithelium types, singularities in the
cell alignments were shown to be correlated with extrusion sites [10], demonstrating that defect-
induced anisotropic stresses are the primary precursors of mechanotransductive responses in cells,
including YAP transcription factor activity [7, 8, 10, 11, 27]. In particular, comet-like topological
defects (defects of order +1 /2, as we will see in the next section) are present on the epithelium
where they are essential to cell extrusion processes [23, 28]. As the comet generates strong com-
pressive stress at its core, it causes the YAP protein to migrate from the nucleus of the cell to its
cytoplasm, causing apoptosis and extrusion [10]. In all the cases observed, the head of the comet
pointed towards the cell to be eliminated. It should be noted that if the defects are responsible for
the extrusion, the converse was not observed and their appearance occurs well before the elimina-
tion of the cells. The statistical analysis of cell velocities in the vicinity of comet-like defects also
showed a sink effect along the defect axis, with cells on both sides of the defect moving inward
([11]).
The comet defects ( m= +1 /2) constitute a large part of the foci for the development of ovarian
cancer metastases on the mesothelium – a specialized type of epithelium – of the abdomen. The
latter is composed of mesothelial cells and presents the same nematic ordering as the epithelial
cells of the ovaries. The study of the mesothelium is of great interest for ovarian cancer since
?????-3Andy Manapany, Loriane Didier, Le ¨ıla Moueddene, Bertrand Berche, S ´ebastien Fumeron
this is where most of the metastases are formed. Unlike comets, trefoil-like defects ( m=−1/2)
display a net outward cell velocity (outside of their legs), leading to a lower cell density in the core
region. Another important feature is that correlations have been observed between the presence of
both types of defects (of order ±1/2) and metastases development, hence reducing the clearance
of cancer cells [11].
3. Thermal tumor ablation, a promising treatment
Delayed diagnosis and treatment of cancer is a major cause of mortality. Thus, the development
of an early treatment of epithelial and metastatic tumors would offer patients better chances
of survival. Since the YAP transcription coactivator promotes tumorigenesis and chemotherapy
resistance [29–34], in principle, controlling its activity could allow a strategic area for therapeutic
purposes in oncology. This could be done in the near future, as the possibility to manipulate defects
in situ with optical tweezers is now within our reach [35]. However, the journey to defect-engineered
therapies based on YAP deactivation promises to be long, as competing mechanisms [36] involving
defect-induced cell motions have recently been reported to impede malignant cell clearance [11].
If currently chemotherapy is very widely used, the efficiency of such long-lasting treatments
decreases with time, as cancer cells continually mutate and develop numerous resistance mecha-
nisms [37]. Therefore, there is very often a relapse of patients who initially responded positively
to treatment. This relapse occurs around 18 months after the start of chemotherapy in the case of
ovarian cancer. A promising alternative, which is less invasive than surgery, is thermal ablation [2],
i.e. killing cancer cells by heat. Different protocols are possible, depending on the heating sources
and durations of application. Among them, radiofrequency, microwave, or ultrasound procedure
allows for localized heating of cancer cells at temperatures ranging from 50 °C to 100 °C for a couple
of minutes (at this temperature, the enzymatic activity of the cells stops irreversibly, leading to
their death). Another alternative to these methods would be hyperthermia in which the tissue is
brought to temperatures neighboring 41 and 45 °C (via methods such as hyperthermic perfusion or
previously aforementioned radiofrequency therapy for instance [38]). Thermal ablation has already
proven to be very effective against certain cancerous tumors such as those of the liver. Thermal
ablation is also less expensive and requires shorter hospital stays than surgery [2].
Summarizing, thermal ablation of metastic tumors is one among various approaches to treat
cancers. As topological defects are correlated to invasive tumor locations, the efficiency of thermal
ablation may likely benefit from understanding how heat transfer occurs inside a defective tissue.
This calls for the elaboration of a simplified heat diffusion model encompassing the salient features
of these complex biophysical phenomena.
4. Heat propagation is influenced by the presence of topological defects
Trefoil and comet-like topological defects of human abdominal mesothelial (inner membrane)
and ovarian epithelial (outer membrane) cells play a central role in ovarian cancers (about 90% of
ovarian cancers are epithelial tumors).
However, few in-vivo studies on thermal ablation therapies have been done to date not only
for reasons of time and cost but also because of the risks of burning the healthy cells surrounding
tumors. Most of the current studies are therefore done by computer modeling and play a major role
in the development of treatments [7], but the field remains largely unexplored and the complexity of
the parameters to be taken into account (friction, presence of walls, density fluctuation, turbulence,
etc) does not allow a universal model.
Here, we elaborate a simple model which allows us to analyse heat propagation in the vicinity
of these topological defects.
4.1. Geometry associated to a disclination of order min a nematic
The geometric theory of defects originates from the pioneering works by Bilby [39] and Kr¨ oner
[40]. It is based on the idea that a displacement field ui(x) in elasticity distorts the distance between
?????-4Differential geometry, a possible avenue for thermal ablation in oncology?3
any pair of points according to:
dl2=δijdyidyj= 
δij+∂iuj+∂jui+δkl∂iuk∂jul
dxidxj(1)
where the indices i, j, . . . run from 1 to 3 for the three space coordinates and we assume the
standard summation rule on repeated indices. Hence everything happens as if the low energy fields
propagate on a curved geometry described by the metric
gij=δij+∂iuj+∂jui+δkl∂iuk∂jul=δij+ 2εij (2)
where εijdenotes the strain tensor.
The general form for the metric around a disclination of order mwas obtained by S´ atiro
and Moraes [21]. Following an original idea proposed by Joets and Ribotta [41], they searched the
effective matter-depending geometry leading to the same geodesics as the light paths obtained from
the Fermat-Grandjean’s principle inside a nematic liquid crystal. Fermat-Grandjean’s principle is
valid not only for light rays but also for sound rays and a version of it for sound rays in an
anisotropic elastic medium (at rest) can be found in [42–44]. As nematic liquid crystals have
uniaxial optical and acoustic properties along the same principal directions, the optical and elastic
Fermat-Grandjean’s principles share the same form and the procedure used by Satiro and Moraes
lead to similar effective Riemann geometries, the dielectric constants of the material being replaced
by the elastic constants. The resulting metric in cylindrical coordinates ( ρ, θ, z ) is of the following
form in terms of the metric tensor4gµν(µandνare space-time indices and run from 0 (time) to
3):
ds2
4D=4gµνdxµdxν=−c2dt2+A(θ)dρ2+B(θ)ρ2dθ2+C(θ)ρdθdz +dz2(3)
with the auxiliary functions
A(θ) = cos2[F(θ)] +α2sin2[F(θ)], (4)
B(θ) = α2cos2[F(θ)] + sin2[F(θ)], (5)
C(θ) = (1 −α2) sin[2 F(θ)], (6)
andF(θ) = ( m−1)θ+φ0. The value of mspecifies the topological charge of the defect and for
the defects of interest in the context of biological tissues, m=±1/2. Such geometry describes a
static defect: in practice +1/2 defects move at about 1 µm/h, therefore the static regime is valid
regarding the typical heating times of thermal therapies. The case m= 1 corresponds to ordinary
disclination lines which are the liquid crystals analogues of cosmic strings. Such line defects can
be formed by either inserting or removing a wedge of material of angle 2 π(1−α) with subsequent
identification of the edges. This is the Volterra cut-and-weld process.
4.2. Heat equation in the presence of topological defects
The heat equation derives from an enthalpy balance and describes the evolution of the temper-
ature field T(r, t) as
∂tT(r, t) =λ∆T(r, t), (7)
with λ=k/(µc) the diffusion coefficient given in terms of the thermal conductivity k, the density
µand specific heat cof the material. In the presence of topological defects, one has to modify this
equation to account for the non-Euclidean geometry (3).
The ADM formalism (Arnowitt, Deser, Misner, [45, 46]) consists in a foliation of spacetime
adapted to the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity. To do so, the 4 Dmetric4gµν
(µ, ν= 0,1,2,3) is decomposed into a 3 Dspace metric gij(i, j= 1,2,3) into slices orthogonal to
the time foliation, gij=4gij,N= (−4g00)−1/2,Ni=4g0iand4g00=−(N2−NiNi). It impliesp
−4g=N√g, with gthe determinant of the 3-metric and Nthe so-called lapse function.
?????-5Andy Manapany, Loriane Didier, Le ¨ıla Moueddene, Bertrand Berche, S ´ebastien Fumeron
This approach was used by Smerlak [19, 47] to write down a heat equation in a foliated space-
time. This requires essentially two modifications: the introduction of the lapse function Nin quan-
tities being derived and the use of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
∆LB(NT) =1√g∂i[√ggij∂j(NT)] (8)
instead of the ordinary Laplacian in a Euclidean manifold. This approach was already used to
study heat propagation in the vicinity of topological defects [48]. In our case the lapse function
N= 1 and the heat equation becomes, in cylindrical coordinates ( ρ, θ, z )

The defect geometry couples the radial and angular coordinates ρandθ, the absence of defect
being recovered in the limit α= 1.
Figure 1. Thermal diffusion (with standard colour code, the red being hotter than the blue)
around defects of various topological charges m. Here the disclination parameter is α= 8. The
initial condition sketched on the left shows that heat flux is imposed by fixing the temperature
T0= 1 on the circular areas shown on the free surface of a finite cylinder (where initially T= 0)
and spreads into space. The different snapshots in the middle show the temperature profile after
a finite amount of time. Overlay of the director field (solid lines) with the temperature profile
(colors) occurs in any plane perpendicular to the defect axis. The phase contrast images on the
right show m=±1/2 defects (taken from Ref. [11]).
This equation is then solved numerically using Mathematica. The solutions are derived as inter-
polation functions using the Finite Element Method. Besides the method, every other parameter
such as step size or accuracy digits is chosen automatically depending on values handled by the
solver. The temperature profile in the vicinity of the topological defect is displayed in the figure 1
for various topological charges ranging from m=−2 tom= 2. The material is supposed to be con-
fined within a cylindric domain centered on the defect axis (the core, in the form of a tiny cylinder
?????-6Differential geometry, a possible avenue for thermal ablation in oncology?4
of radius Rcutoff , is excluded to avoid numerical divergences) to preserve the axial symmetry. This
symmetry is compatible with the application proposed in the following sections where the heat
source is produced by a needle-shaped antenna. The temperature in this section is fixed at the set
value T0(Dirichlet boundary conditions), either from inside the cylinder or from outside of it (see
figure 2, left). The boundary conditions are chosen periodic on the upper and lower walls of the
cylinder and in the angular direction. The temperature profiles corresponding to different times
are shown in figure 2. The cylinder being finite, the asymptotic regime at t→ ∞ corresponds to a
stationary and uniform temperature profile at T0. When heating a tissue, a 1/2-defect leaves an un-
equivocal thermal signature on the temperature profile: on figure 1, the nematic director field does
superimpose to the temperature field in the plane perpendicular to the defect axis. Such results
may have important outcomes for diagnosis. Diffusion along the axis is not coupled to the other
coordinates and thus is not essential there, so in the following, we will keep only representations
in the perpendicular planes.
Figure 2. Temperature profiles at various times for the comet (left) and trefoil (right) defect
subject to a heat flux at the defect core at a temperature T0= 46◦C (top) and T0= 75◦C
(bottom). The snapshots are taken at times from t= 1 s to t= 1000 s from left to right
(T0= 46◦C) and from t= 1 s to t= 100 s from left to right ( T0= 75◦C). The first line shows
the temperature profile in the presence only of the topological defect ( α= 4, m=±1/2), the
second line with the Pennes term only in a purely Euclidean geometry with isotropic temperature
profiles, and the third line represents the model of biological tissue with both the topological
defect and the Pennes term. Here, R0= 5mm (burning scale), R2= 10mm (external scale) and
the cutoff scale is Rcutoff = 0.1 mm.
5. Model of heat propagation around topological defects in biological tis-
sues
Biological tissues are not just inert materials but are rather examples of active matter, i.e. non-
equilibrium self-organized systems which do not couple trivially to the energy input. Among them,
epithelia are the archetype of active nematic liquid crystals [49], each epithelial cell being fuelled
by its metabolic activity. The bioheat equation of Pennes [16] has been introduced to describe
arterial temperature in the human forearm. Compared the ordinary heat equation, it comprises
?????-7Andy Manapany, Loriane Didier, Le ¨ıla Moueddene, Bertrand Berche, S ´ebastien Fumeron
additional terms that include the metabolic contribution (volumic heat source) and the influence
of blood flow (convective correction),
µtct∂T(r, t)
∂t=k∆LBT(r, t)−µbcbω(T−Ta) +qm. (10)
The l.h.s corresponds to energy storage (there, µtis the tissue density [kg/m3] and ctits specific
heat [J/(kg.K)], like µandcin the previous section) and the Laplacian on the r.h.s. (here ∆ LB
indicates the presence of the topological defect) describes as usual the temperature diffusion inside
the tissue (with kthe tissue thermal conductivity [J/(s.m.K)]). In biological tissues, there are also
at least two sources of energy. The heat transferred by convection by blood to the tissue is described
by the second term at the r.h.s. (with µbandcbthe blood density and specific heat, ωthe local blood
perfusion – which ensures the transport of nutrients and waste products towards and outwards the
cells– and Tathe arterial temperature) and finally, the heat produced by the tissue metabolism
given by the source term, qm. In the case of a local thermal treatment, an additional term qpcan be
introduced as well. Despite its extreme simplicity (the assumption that thermal equilibrium may
occur in the capillaries has been questioned) and although several mechanisms are missing from
Pennes’ equation (the blood velocity field does not appear, the role of thermoregulation, or memory
effects are absent, see e.g. [17, 50–53]), it yet captures from a limited number of parameters the
salient biophysics of human tissues and is widely used to simulate bioheat transfers at different
scales.
To identify general patterns, we introduce the dimensionless parameters ¯ r=ρ/R (with ρthe
cylindrical coordinate radial distance) and Θ = ( T−Ta)/T0with T0the setpoint temperature
corresponding to a given thermotherapy, and a typical scale of time
τ=µtctR2/k. (11)
Neglecting the metabolic term, the Pennes’ equation then writes as
τ∂Θ(¯r, t)
∂t=¯∆LBΘ(¯r, t)−Bi Θ( ¯r, t) (12)
where the Biot number is
Bi = µbcbωR2/k. (13)
We now compare heat propagation in the inert nematic material to its biological counterpart.
We focus on the cases of comet ( m= +1 /2) and trefoil ( m=−1/2) defects. Profiles at different
times measure the ability of the heat flux to diffuse into the material (figure 2). As time increases,
warmer areas expand in an anisotropic manner, as a result of the presence of the topological defect
(except the isotropic diffusion when α= 1, i.e. no defect at all in that case). In figure 2, the first
lines show the heat flow in an ordinary nematic in the presence of a topological defect, the second
lines correspond to Pennes bioheat equation without any defect and the third lines correspond to
the model of interest where the bioheat equation is solved in the presence of the topological defect.
Several observations are worth noting. Heat propagates along preferential directions (along three
main legs for the trefoil, or one side, say ahead or backward, even though there is no front/rear
distinction here). In all cases, the heat flows in the vicinity of the defect core and the temperature
in the defect core area remains much higher than in the rest of the system. This is very positive
for the application considered here, since ultimately, we will focus on bio-tissues with defects that
concentrate metastatic cells in their core region.
In figure 3 we present in grey the burnt areas, in the same geometrical conditions as in figure 2
for comet defects.Triggering cell apoptosis depends both on the value of the temperature and
the time of exposure: typically, cells die when they are exposed at 46◦C during 15 min while
they die almost instantaneously when submitted above 60◦C. Thus, by ”burnt areas”, we mean
regions exposed at 46◦C during 15 min, or at 60◦C at least during a few seconds, or, by simple
interpolation, 55◦C during 400 seconds. Since we found no data at this temperature, that is the
simplest approximation we can do. Possible improvements are discussed in the conclusion.

Figure 3. Burnt areas for various protocols in the case of a comet-like defect ( α= 4,m= +1 /2).
Left: tissue exposed to a source at T0= 49◦C. The grey areas at various times represent the part
of the system subject to 46◦C during an exposure time of at least 900 s. Right: tissue exposed
to a source at T0= 75◦C. The grey areas at various times represent the part of the system
subject to 75◦C during an exposure time of at least 1 s. The three lines correspond to the same
convention as in figures 2.
The next question to address is the efficiency of the different protocols of heating: off-center
heating (figure 4 shows that this is essential to aim at the target precisely), high temperatures
for short times (evaporation), lower temperatures applied longer (hyperthermia), and finally a fine
balance between temperature level and duration of application (coagulation). The three situations
will be discussed in the next section.

6. Towards a case-by-case treatment recommendation
We now provide an analysis of the efficiency of thermal ablation protocols for different kinds
of biological tissues. We target by thermal ablation a tumor of radius Rt, from a uniform heating
protocol on a scale Rb< R t. The tumor is considered as destroyed (burnt) if it has been exposed
for a sufficient time, tb, to a temperature at least equal to a value fixed Tb, as explained in the
previous section. The different protocols allow to vary the values of Rb,tb, and Tb. Healthy tissues
outside the tumor must be preserved (a sketch is shown on figure 5).
Each tissue is characterized by the values of the parameters Bi and τ(see table 1 for the

biophysical characteristics of different tissues). In the plane of these parameters, we determine,
for a sample of cylindrical tissue of radius R2, the percentage of the burnt area after a certain
time has elapsed, for an imposed setpoint temperature fixed at 49◦C, 55◦C and 75◦C respectively.
When this percentage reaches a proportion about 20% to 40% of the area of the tissue, a tumor of
characteristic radius Rt≃R2/2 is considered destroyed ( R2
t∼0.25R2
b). These numbers are chosen
for the facility of the representation, but should of course be adapted to the tumor size.
Figure 5. Left: An example of tumor located at the center of a comet defect (taken from
Ref. [11]). Center: Sketch (this is an artificial image) of a tumor at the core of a topological
defect. The green area represents the tumor of radius Rt, and the red contour shows the area,
of radius Rb, which is submitted to the heating source. For the following geometric parameters
Rb= 4 mm (burning scale), R2= 20 mm (external scale). Right: Evolution of the relative burnt
area in the plane of parameters τvs Bi. The red part on the surface corresponds to the targeted
size burnt for a tumor of size Rt= 10 mm (tumor scale). Three tissues are located in this
parameter space.
We have displayed three different tissues (liver, prostate, and skin) in the Bi −τplane. These
points would represent the target to be reached by the white area. The position of these targets
depends on the biophysical parameters, but also on the size of the tumor via the definition of Bi
andτ. In the present example, Rt= 5 mm, but for a tumor of half size, the values of τand Bi
would be reduced by a factor of 4.
Figure 6 shows our results for comet defects heated at Tb= 49◦C during tb= 100 s and 900 s.
The target is not reached for any of the tissues considered, since they are not in the white area
which corresponds to the expected 20% to 40% of the area burnt. In all three cases, the fraction
of the area burnt only covers partially the tumor size.
AtTb= 55◦C,tb= 20 s on the other hand (figure 7), the conditions are fulfilled for the liver
and prostate tissues, and for the skin, they are satisfied for Tb= 75◦C,tb= 20 s (figure 8), while
at that temperature, the treatment is too aggressive and a significative part of healthy tissue is
also destroyed.
Our analysis suggests that prostate and liver tumors should preferably be treated via coagu-
lation protocols (e.g. 55 °C, 20-50 sec), while skin tumors are better treated by evaporation (e.g.

whole extent. Although these are very strong statements, we should be cautious with these conclu-
sions which follow from a physical model of a biological tissue, and not from in-vivo studies. The

criterion used to decide about the area burnt is also still very approximate, and a careful study of
the conditions of apoptosis of cancer cells should be performed to improve the modelization.
7. Key statements, recommendations, and limitations
This work introduces a model of heat diffusion in a biological tissue containing half-integer
topological defects. Comet-like defects ( m= +1 /2) are involved in YAP activity and tumorigenesis,
but they may also trap tumor cells and could serve as reliable snitches for image-guided thermal
therapies. The computations show that the optimal point for tumor burning is very sensitive to the
thermophysical properties of the surrounding tissue. They provide a tool to recommend a case-by-
case treatment likely to destroy efficiently the tumor cells while preserving the surrounding healthy
tissues.
Several avenues of improvement can therefore be identified to extend the present work. First,
we opted for a cylindrical setting to comply with the defect symmetry, but in practice, this may
not reflect the local peculiarities of body organs (yet, changing the setting is not an obstacle in
principle and it can be treated from a fully numerical approach.
Second, some of the approximations that we made were due to a lack of knowledge of the
properties of the biological tissues (partly due to our ignorance of a part of the literature available,
partly because the studies have not yet been performed). For example, the dependence of the
biophysical properties of in-vivo tissues with temperature and heat damage is not taken into account
(recent results evidenced temperature-dependent non-linear changes of the thermal properties of
ex-vivo liver [58, 59], brain and pancreas [60] tissues), but there is no theoretical obstacle to
incorporate this in the model. More delicate would be to account for heat sink effects of perfusion
within in vivo tissue, and those effects are highly non-linear. Living systems dynamically respond
to heat sources, dilating blood vessels and increasing interstitial transport to reduce heat build-
up. The thermal damage could also be treated more rigorously using damage models [61, 62],
like Henriques’s burn integral [61] or the Cumulative Equivalent Minutes at 43◦C dose model
(CEM43) which expresses the thermal load on living tissues by estimating the equivalent induced
thermal stress in minutes at 43◦C [63]. Finally, improvements to the model should be made in the
implementation of the heat source in the tissue. Here, we consider that the heat source is applied
locally , but in a uniform manner at the inner part of the tissue where the tumor sits, while there
should be a penetration law from this inner part to the outer of the tissue. The protocol proposed
is also to apply a constant temperature during time tc, but obvious extensions could be considered
for example cycles of heating-deheating.
Another improvement of our model consists in taking into account the thermal history of the
?????-12Differential geometry, a possible avenue for thermal ablation in oncology?7
tumor, as this may affect its tolerance to hyperthermia. Several recent works [64–66] showed that
fractional calculus was a well-suited tool to account for memory effects in biological media.
Despite all the limitations that we have just mentioned and the essential precautions that must
be taken with the recommendations to be drawn, this simple model seems very promising to us
and can easily be improved to get closer to realistic employment conditions.
