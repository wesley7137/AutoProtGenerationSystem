Title: Novel insights into the pleiotropic health effects of growth differentiation factor 11 gained from genome-wide association studies in population biobanks.
Abstract: Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily that has gained considerable attention over the last decade for its observed ability to reverse age-related deterioration of multiple tissues, including the heart. Yet as many researchers have struggled to confirm the cardioprotective and anti-aging effects of GDF11, the topic has grown increasingly controversial, and the field has reached an impasse. We postulated that a clearer understanding of GDF11 could be gained by investigating its health effects at the population level.
