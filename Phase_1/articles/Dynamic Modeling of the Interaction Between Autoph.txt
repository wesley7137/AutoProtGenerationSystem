Title: Dynamic Modeling of the Interaction Between Autophagy and Apoptosis in
  Mammalian Cells
Abstract:   Autophagy is a conserved biological stress response in mammalian cells that
is responsible for clearing damaged proteins and organelles from the cytoplasm
and recycling their contents via the lysosomal pathway. In cases of mild
stress, autophagy acts as a survival mechanism, while in cases of severe stress
cells may switch to programmed cell death. Understanding the decision process
that moves a cell from autophagy to apoptosis is important since abnormal
regulation of autophagy occurs in many diseases, including cancer. To integrate
existing knowledge about this decision process into a rigorous, analytical
framework, we built a mathematical model of cell fate decisions mediated by
autophagy. Our dynamical model is consistent with existing quantitative
measurements of autophagy and apoptosis in rat kidney proximal tubular cells
responding to cisplatin-induced stress.

Autophagy is a conserved biological stress response in mammalian cells that is responsible for clearing damaged proteins
and organelles from the cytoplasm and recycling their contents via the lysosomal pathway. In cases of mild stress, autophagy
acts as a survival mechanism, while in cases of severe stress cells may switch to programmed cell death. Understanding the
decision process that moves a cell from autophagy to apoptosis is important since abnormal regulation of autophagy occursin many diseases, including cancer. To integrate existing knowledge about this decision process into a rigorous, analytical
framework, we built a mathematical model of cell fate decisions mediated by autophagy. Our dynamical model is consistent
with existing quantitative measurements of autophagy and apoptosis in rat kidney proximal tubular cells responding tocisplatin-induced stress.

Autophagy and its dysregulation play important roles in the
pathogenesis of many complex diseases.1For instance,
autophagy helps cancer cells to survive the stresses of
nutrient deprivation and anoxia.2Autophagy is also involved
in the development of resistance to chemotherapy; inhibi-ting autophagy can increase the therapeutic responses ofresistant cancer cells to chemotherapy, endocrine therapy,or radiation therapy.
3,4While autophagy is normally initiated
as a prosurvival response to stress, excessive stress cantrigger cell death.
Recently, we proposed a systems biology approach to
model the complex interplay among pathways for estro-gen and growth factor signaling, unfolded proteinresponse (UPR) stress, autophagy, and apoptosis in thecontext of breast cancer responses to endocrine therapy.

Other authors as well have argued that mathematical the-ories of the systems-level properties of molecular signal-ing networks will play pivotal roles in the emerging fieldof systems pharmacology.
6In particular, several mathemat-
ical models of autophagy have been proposed recently.Martin et al .
7presented a computational model of auto-
phagic vesicle dynamics in single cells, but they did notaddress the crucial interplay between autophagy and apo-ptosis. Kapuy et al .
8addressed this interplay using a sim-
plified mathematical model, but they did not compare theirsimulations with experimental measurements of how cellsrespond to stress. Our motivation for building mathematicalmodels of autophagy and apoptosis is to integrate currentmechanistic knowledge of these processes into a coherentframework and to determine if the mechanisms we includecan explain existing qualitative observations and quantita-tive data on autophagic responses of cells to stress. Asmore data become available, this model can serve as afoundation for better models, with the goal of accurately
predicting how therapeutic interventions may alter cell fatesin normal and diseased tissues.
MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY OF AUTOPHAGY AND
APOPTOSIS
Autophagy is a conserved catabolic cellular process by
which a cell degrades its own components, including dam-aged proteins and organelles. Autophagosomes (subcellularorganelles enclosed by two or more membranes) engulfdamaged materials, fuse with lysosomes, and the resultingautolysosome then uses lysosomal enzymes to degradethe contents of the autophagic vacuoles.
1Autophagy-
related proteins (ATG proteins) drive autophagosome for-mation in yeast and mammalian cells.
1,9Commitment of a
cell to autophagy seems to occur at the earliest stages ofvesicle nucleation and formation of the isolation membrane,a small, flattened membrane sac that elongates and curvesto create an autophagosome.
1,9
Major molecular players in the induction of autophagy in
mammalian cells are mTOR (the mammalian target of rapa-mycin) and ATG13. mTOR is a signal integrator that sensesstress conditions such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)stress, hypoxia, low growth factor levels, or low levels ofessential amino acids.
10When there are no critical stress
conditions in the cell, a protein complex consisting of mam-malian ATG13, Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1(ULK1, the mammalian homolog of yeast Atg1), and focaladhesion kinase interacting protein of 200 kD (FIP200)is repressed by mTOR phosphorylation of ATG13 andULK1. Cellular stress inactivates mTOR, allowing the

tion as antiautophagy proteins through their inhibitory bind-ing with Beclin-1. Although Beclin-1 contains a BCL-2homology domain 3 (BH3), it is not proapoptotic.
1,12For
autophagosome formation to begin, Beclin-1 must bereleased from BCL-2 inhibition, which is promoted by eitherphosphorylation of BCL-2 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK), or by phosphorylation of Beclin-1 by death-
associated protein kinase (DAPK).
13–16Free Beclin-1 then
binds with other partners to form a “Beclin-1 core complex,”which promotes vesicle nucleation.

For more details about the physiology and molecular biol-
ogy of autophagy, we refer the reader to our review article.3
A convenient quantitative measure of autophagosome
formation in mammalian cells is the state of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3),
17which is a mam-
malian homolog of yeast Atg8. LC3 exists in two forms:LC3-I (cytosolic form, 18 kDa) and LC3-II (membrane-bound form, 16 kDa). After autophagy initiation, LC3-I isconverted to LC3-II, which then participates in the vesicleelongation step of autophagosome formation.
1,17LC3-II can
be distinguished from LC3-I by immunoblotting. Alterna-tively, autophagosome formation can be visualized as green“puncta” by tagging LC3 with green fluorescent protein.
18
In contrast to autophagy, the molecular regulatory system
that controls apoptosis is reasonably well understood. Theextrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways leading tocaspase-dependent apoptosis have been studied by mathe-matical modeling.
5,19,20We focus on the intrinsic pathway,
which leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabiliza-tion (MOMP), causing release of cytochrome C into the cyto-plasm and subsequent activation of executioner caspases.The induction of MOMP is dependent on oligomerization ofproapoptotic proteins (BAX or BAK) in the outer mitochon-drial membrane, while antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins inthe mitochondria inhibit these proapoptotic proteins. Activa-tion of BAX and BAK is triggered by BH3-only proteins.
1,19
Crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis
BCL-2 family proteins in the ER and mitochondria are
important regulators of autophagy and apoptosis, respec-tively.
21,22Hence, different levels of expression of BCL-2
proteins in the ER membrane and in the mitochondrialmembrane may lead to different activation dynamics forautophagy and apoptosis. Calcium signaling from the ER tomitochondria may also play a role in autophagy-apoptosiscrosstalk.
21–25The inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor
(IP3R) and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca21-ATPase
(SERCA) pump are the central regulators of Ca21
exchange between ER and cytoplasm. By pumping Ca21
from the cytosol into the ER, SERCA is responsible for
maintaining very low calcium ion concentrations in the cyto-plasm. Conversely, IP3R is a stress-activated Ca
21channel
that releases Ca21from the ER into the cytoplasm.22–26Normally, IP3R is sequestered by BCL-2 family proteins in
the ER membrane.27Phosphorylation of BCL-2 proteins dis-
sociates the complex and allows for calcium release fromthe ER.
28Sustained, elevated cytoplasmic Ca21can lead to
apoptosis.22,23,29Cytoplasmic Ca21can also inhibit mTOR
via activation of calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase- b
(CaMKK b), which activates AMPK (50AMP-activated protein
kinase). AMPK has an inhibitory effect on mTOR.30
Calcium influx into mitochondria can induce apoptosis
directly, and several other signaling pathways also link sus-tained calcium elevation to apoptosis.
22,23,29,31,32For exam-
ple, calcium activates calcineurin, which dephosphorylates
and activates BAD, a proapoptotic BCL-2 family protein capa-
ble of inducing apoptosis.33In addition, calcium can activate
calpain, a cysteine protease that cleaves ATG5, an essentialprotein for autophagosome formation. Truncated ATG5 indu-ces apoptosis by suppressing antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins inthe mitochondria.
1,34,35The mechanism of this suppression is
unknown; so, for modeling purposes, we assume that trun-cated ATG5 upregulates proapoptotic BH3 proteins. Duringapoptosis, the activation of caspase 8 downregulates auto-phagosome formation by cleaving Beclin-1.

apoptosis, we refer the reader to the excellent review articleby Marino et al.

METHODS: MATHEMATICAL MODELING APPROACH
From these facts we draw an “influence diagram” ( Figure 1 ),
which summarizes our hypothesis about the most relevantmolecular interactions between autophagy and apoptosis inmammalian cells. In Supplementary Text S1 , we convert
this influence diagram into a mathematical model. Our math-ematical model is formulated in terms of 21 variables(Table 1 ) whose response to stress is described by the differ-
ential and algebraic equations in Table 2 . The equations
were solved numerically using the MatLab code (MathWorks,
Natick, MA) in Supplementary Text S2 . As described in
Supplementary Text S3 , we fitted model simulations to
experimental data ( Supplementary Table S1 ) to obtain the
“optimal” set of parameter values in Table 3 . Using these
optimal parameter values, we computed the steady-state val-ues of all variables under no-stress conditions ( C50; see
Table 1 ). These values were used as initial conditions for
simulations of how cells respond to stress ( C>0).
To examine the generic properties of our model, we solve
the governing equations for fixed (optimal) values of theparameters and varying levels of stress, C. These simula-
tions represent how an “average” cell might respond tostress, but they cannot be compared to the observedbehavior of a population of cells responding to cisplatin,because, in the latter case, we must take into account theheterogeneous response of cells to apoptotic signals. Weattribute this heterogeneity to differences among cells inthe mitochondrial concentration of BCL2, because (in ourmodel) this parameter most sensitively determines whetheror not apoptosis occurs, and if so, when. Using randomlyselected [BCL2
mit] levels from a lognormal distribution, we
simulate 100 cells and record the average value of everyDynamic Modeling of the Interaction

CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacologyvariable, including the percentage of cells having under-
gone apoptosis at each timepoint.
Although we attribute cellular heterogeneity entirely to
fluctuations in [BCL2 mit], this assumption is clearly an over-
simplification. Other sources of variability, e.g., in BH3 pro-duction or ATG5 cleavage, may well contribute to thevariable commitment of cells to apoptosis. Nonetheless, ourassumption is a simple and effective way to fit the model toexperimental observations of percent apoptosis.
Before we can compare our model to data (which has
some level of uncertainty), we must quantify how uncertainwe are about the optimal parameter values given in
Table 3 . To this end, we describe, in Supplementary Text
S3, how we perturbed the optimal set of parameter values
to obtain alternative sets of parameter values that provide“acceptable” fits of model simulations to the experimentaldata. We created a collection of 3,758 “acceptable sets ofparameter values” and all simulations of experimental dataare based on samples from this collection. In this way wetake into account our uncertainty about the parameter val-ues and the consequent range of predictions that are madeby the model. In Table 3 we record the coefficient of

RESULTS
The experimental data we seek to explain involve the
response of rat kidney proximal tubule (RPT) cells to treat-ment with cisplatin, a widely and effectively used antineo-plastic drug. Cisplatin induces the UPR and activation ofJNK and DAPK in mammalian cells.
40–42Periyasamy-
Thandavan et al .18used RPT cells, transiently transfected
with GFP-LC3 and treated with cisplatin, to investigate thecytoprotective role of autophagy. To study the time course ofautophagosome formation, the investigators measured tem-poral changes in cisplatin-induced LC3 puncta by fluores-cence microscopy, and LC3-II production by immunoblotting.They also measured the autophagic response and the per-centage of apoptotic cells when RPT cells were treated withcisplatin in the presence or absence of bafilomycin (BAF)and 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which are inhibitors of autoph-agy. To compare our model calculations with experimental
data, we equated the autophagy level in our model,[ATPHG], with the LC3-II level measured by immunoblotting.Programmed cell death in our model is associated with an“indicator function” [CASP], which takes the value 0 in livingcells and the value 1 when a cell commits to apoptosis,which occurs as soon as [BH3] exceeds [BCL2
mit].
Generic properties of the model
The behavior of an “average” cell to cisplatin-induced stressis predicted by simulating the equations in Table 2 with the
optimal parameter values in Table 3 (with [BCL2
mit] fixed at
0.12), starting from the steady-state initial conditions in
Table 1 .I nFigure 2a,b we show how 13 of our variables
change over the course of time for an average cellresponding to a continuous dose of cisplatin, C520 in the
model. (For time courses of all variables in the model, seeSupplementary Figure S1 .) Most changes occur within
the first few hours, as the cells quickly activate autophagyto respond to the stress. Then, at t518 hours, executioner
caspases are activated and the autophagic responseswitches off ( Figure 2c ) as the cell becomes apoptotic.
These general characteristics of the response are consist-ent with the behavior of cells exposed to 20 lM cisplatin.
18
Indeed, parameter values in the model are chosen so that
simulation results at C520 correspond to experimental
results at a cisplatin dose of 20 lM.
InFigure 2c we show how the level of autophagy, over
the course of 4 days, responds to a range of cisplatin dosesup to C5100. For low doses, [ATPHG] rises quickly (6–8
hours) to a steady-state level, in order to counteract thestress caused by cisplatin. For larger doses, [ATPHG] risesquickly but then falls to zero as BH3 proteins accumulate inthe overstressed cells, which commit apoptosis when[BH3]5[BCL2
mit]50.12. In Figure 2c , one can see the
activation of apoptosis as a kink in [ATPHG]( t) when [CASP]
switches from 0 to 1. For C5100, 20, and 6, CASP is
activated at t57.5, 18, and 59 hours, respectively. The apo-
ptotic response (in our model) is driven primarily by calpain-dependent ATG5 cleavage, which dials back the productionof autophagosomes and produces proapoptotic, truncatedATG5 molecules. Presumably these effects are intended toforce cells to commit to apoptosis under conditions of highstress. Caspase activation cleaves Beclin-1 and turns off for-mation of autophagosomes. Beyond this timepoint, theremaining autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes and are
degraded, with [A TPHG] ultimately decaying to zero.
InFigure 2d we repeat this simulation for a population of
100 cells with [BCL2
mit] following a lognormal distribution
and plot the population-average level of autophagy at t5
100 hours. (We simulate to t5100 hours to be reasonably
sure that the dynamical model has reached its steady-stateresponse.) For C<5, autophagy ramps up with stress level
and most cells survive. For 5 <C<6, the average level of
autophagy drops with increasing Cbecause some—but not
all—cells in the population die. For C>6, all cells in the
population are dead by t5100 hours. To explore this switch
between autophagy and apoptosis more closely, we plot (inFigure 2e ) the percent apoptosis as a function of cisplatin
dose at various timepoints from 6 hours to 100 hours.Table 2 Equations defining the model

CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems PharmacologyApoptosis in our model is an all-or-none commitment of
individual cells because we assume that MOMP is gov-
erned by a bistable switch. As described in ref.19, the
switch is flipped from the “living” state to the “dying” statewhen [BH3] exceeds [BCL2
mit] in the mitochondrial outer
membrane. The all-or-none nature of the transition in themodel is reflected in the fact that most cells survive for C<
5 and most cells die for C>6. For 5 <C<6; only a frac-
tion of cells die because of the lognormal distribution weassume for [BCL2
mit]. Experimental confirmation of the
“threshold” effects in Figure 2d,e provide strong support for
a “bistable switch” underlying MOMP , an assumption of themodel that is still a subject of some disagreement amongtheoreticians.

Quantitative comparison of the model to autophagyand apoptosis in populations of RPT cellsFor quantitative comparison, we chose an “optimal” set ofparameter values ( Table 3 ) to best fit the data ( Supple-
mentary Table S1 ), as detailed in Supplementary
Text S3 . Recognizing that the available data are insufficient
to constrain the values of all the parameters in our model,we generated a collection of 3,758 parameter sets that alsoprovided good fits to the data. Simulations using these
acceptable parameter sets enable us to compute error bars
for our simulation results.
InFigure 3a , we plot the model’s prediction of autophagy
level in response to a cisplatin dose of 20 lM(C520).
For each of the acceptable parameter sets, we simulatedthe response of 100 cells, each with a particular value of[BCL2
mit]. For each parameter set, we compute, from the
sample of 100 cells, the mean value of [ATPHG]( t) and the
percentage of apoptotic cells at each point in time. Then,from the sample of 3,758 acceptable parameter sets, weplot the mean (black line) 6one standard deviation of
autophagy and percent apoptosis as functions of time. Thesimulations compare very favorably with the experimentaldata (circles) from figure 6d of Periyasamy-Thandavanet al .
18The experimental points are singlets and said, by
the authors, to be “ representative of at least three separate
experiments .” To get an idea of the variability of these
measurements, one should compare figures 1a, 4d, 5d,and 6d in ref.
18. In these experiments, the level of autoph-
agy increases to a maximum at /C246 hours, after which neg-
ative feedback from Ca21causes the level of autophagy to
decrease. As cells become apoptotic, the average level ofTable 3 Parameters, their descriptions, their optimal values, and their coefficients of variation over the collection of acceptable parameter sets

experiment, we increased BCL-2 expression by 3-fold inboth the ER and mitochondria. The reduced autophagicresponse (in the model) is due to excess BCL-2 protein
binding Beclin-1 and preventing initiation of autophagy. At
the same time, cell death is also inhibited because thehigher BCL-2 level in mitochondria cannot be over-whelmed by the elevated levels of BH3 in response to
cisplatin treatment.Inhibition of autophagosome docking
The key function of autophagosomes is to engulf damagedcellular material and then fuse with lysosomes, where thecollected material is degraded and recycled. Bafilomycin(BAF) is widely used to block the fusion of autophago-somes with lysosomes, resulting in accumulation of auto-phagosomes in the cytoplasm. Figure 3c displays the
increased accumulation of autophagosomes in both experi-ment and simulation after cells were treated with 20 lM cis-
platin in combination with 100 nM BAF . To simulate theeffect of BAF treatment in the model, both the absorptionrate of autophagosomes ( k
da) and (consequently) the rate
of stress reduction by autophagy ( kra) are reduced 5-fold. It
is interesting to note that, when cells are challenged with20lM cisplatin 1100 nM BAF , the maximum autophagy
level is the same as that observed with 20 lM cisplatin
alone, although cells treated with BAF should have much

CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacologyhigher stress than cells treated without BAF . In the model,
higher stress strongly activates calpain, which cleaves
ATG5 and limits the maximum level of autophagy. If calpainis inhibited, cells are observed to die by excess autoph-agy,
43and we see a massive increase in autophagy when
calpain is inhibited in a simulated treatment with 20 lM cis-
platin1100 nM BAF ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). This
role of calpain may have evolved to avert autophagic deathin cells subjected to high stress.
Impaired fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes puts
the cell under increased stress and should lead toincreased apoptosis. In the experiment, 55% of cells wereapoptotic at 12 hours, compared to 53% of the simulatedcells ( Figure 4a ). The model predicts that 89% of cells will
be apoptotic at 24 hours ( Figure 4b ).
Inhibition of autophagosome formation
3-MA inhibits formation of autophagosomes. In responseto treatment with 20 lM cisplatin 110 mM 3-MA, both
experiments and simulations show a decreased level ofautophagy ( Figure 3d ) compared to treatment with 20 lM
cisplatin alone ( Figure 3a ). To simulate the effect of 3-
MA, the parameter controlling formation of autophago-somes ( k
a) was decreased 2-fold. As with BAF , the
decrease in autophagic recycling of cellular material
caused by 3-MA should increase cell death. Experimen-tally, 46% of cells were apoptotic at 12 hours compared to38% of the simulated cells at this point ( Figure 4a ). The
level of apoptosis is not quite as high as for BAF treat-ment, suggesting higher autophagic recycling in the caseof 3-MA treatment. Similarly, inhibition of autophagy, byknocking down Beclin-1 while treating cells with 20 lM
cisplatin, also results in increased apoptosis, both experi-mentally (55% at 16 hours) and in simulation (57%). (Inthe simulation, we reduced the initial value of [BECN1]
T
by 50%.) As expected, the model predicts significantlyhigher percentages of apoptotic cells at 24 hours in allcases ( Figure 4b ). We suggest that future experiments
measuring apoptosis in cells responding to high cisplatinstress be carried out to 24 hours and beyond, to deter-mine whether most cells eventually commit apoptosis, aspredicted by our model ( Figure 3e ).
Our model also accounts for the proapoptotic effect of 3-
MA at a cisplatin dose of 5 lM(Figure 4a , as compared to
figure 7c of Periyasamy-Thandavan et al.
18). Because very
few cells commit apoptosis at a dose of 5 lM cisplatin, we

www.wileyonlinelibrary/psp4cannot associate this dose with C55, which lies at the
cusp of life-or-death in our model. Although the model wasparameterized to fit data at a cisplatin dose of 20 lM with
C520, there is no reason to expect that the parameter C,
which measures metabolic stress, should bear a linear rela-tion to cisplatin dose. Hence, we choose C52.5, where
cells are robustly surviving in the model, to represent thecase of cisplatin 55lM in experiments.

DISCUSSION
Recent advances in molecular cell biology indicate that
anticancer therapies promote cellular stress, which can trig-ger both autophagy and apoptosis.
3,44Hence, understand-
ing the interactions among the molecular regulators ofthese major cell survival/death pathways is critical to solv-ing clinical issues associated with drug efficacy and sideeffects. In this study, we show that a mathematical modelof cellular stress can capture the prosurvival and prodeathresponses of cells in qualitative terms and be fitted accu-rately to quantitative time-course data of autophagy andapoptosis measured by Periyasamy-Thandavan et al .
18
The model predicts the time courses of regulatory proteins
(Figure 2a,b ) and the long-term extent of apoptosis
(Figures 2e and4b), which were not measured in the origi-
nal experiments. The model predicts that, for the rat kidneycells studied here, the role of cytoplasmic calcium ions inupregulating apoptosis proceeds less through calcineurin’sactivation of proapoptotic proteins than through calpain’s
truncation of ATG5. Future quantitative measurements ofhow cells respond to cytotoxic stress will allow us to testthis model and build new versions with more predictivepower. In addition, experiments that interfere with apoptosisin cells responding to cisplatin, e.g., by manipulating apo-ptosis activators and inhibitors, such as secondmitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), will provide datato further support and improve the model.
Cell stress responses, such as autophagy and apoptosis,
are central to determining the responses of cancer patientsto pharmacological interventions. For example, autophagyis commonly associated with the acquisition of drug resist-ance by cancer cells and contributes to the poor patientsurvival rate of many cancers. On the positive side, autoph-agy plays a cytoprotective role in cisplatin nephrotoxicity.Because autophagy and apoptosis are governed by an intri-cate dynamic network of interacting proteins, it is imperative
to identify and target key components of this network when
designing therapeutic regimens for diseases such as can-cer.
45–47An accurate, cancer-specific mathematical model
can advance the pharmacodynamic analysis of prospectiveanticancer agents and help find novel combinations of exist-ing therapies that increase the death of cancer cells usinglow doses that spare normal cells.

Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THETOPIC?
Autophagy and apoptosis regulate cell fate in response to
stress. Experimental studies provide quantitative dataon cell survival and death in response to stress. But nocomputational models have yet attended to the dynami-cal interplay of autophagy and apoptosis in relation tothe experimental data.
WHAT QUESTIONS DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?
Can a simple mathematical model of the regulation ofautophagy and apoptosis effectively account for theobserved responses of rat cells to exposure to the cyto-toxic drug cisplatin?
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE
Since the model presented here is consistent with thedata used for its validation, it provides an initial steptowards better understanding of the complex interac-tions among cell fate pathways.
HOW THIS MIGHT CHANGE CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS
Optimizing therapeutic protocols, especially those involving
multiple drugs, will require a detailed understanding of the
balance between survival and death in both diseased and
normal cells. Dynamic models, such as the autophagy-apoptosis model presented here, can play a key role inunderstanding and computing optimal protocols.
