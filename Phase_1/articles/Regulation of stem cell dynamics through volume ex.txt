Title: Regulation of stem cell dynamics through volume exclusion
Abstract:   Maintenance and regeneration of adult tissues rely on the self-renewal of
stem cells. Regeneration without over-proliferation requires precise regulation
of the stem cell proliferation and differentiation rates. The nature of such
regulatory mechanisms in different tissues, and how to incorporate them in
models of stem cell population dynamics, is incompletely understood. The
critical birth-death (CBD) process is widely used to model stem cell
populations, capturing key phenomena, such as scaling laws in clone size
distributions. However, the CBD process neglects regulatory mechanisms. Here,
we propose the birth-death process with volume exclusion (vBD), a variation of
the birth-death process that considers crowding effects, such as may arise due
to limited space in a stem cell niche. While the deterministic rate equations
predict a single non-trivial attracting steady state, the master equation
predicts extinction and transient distributions of stem cell numbers with three
possible behaviours: long-lived quasi-steady state, and short-lived bimodal or
unimodal distributions. In all cases, we approximate solutions to the vBD
master equation using a renormalised system-size expansion, quasi-steady state
approximation and the WKB method. Our study suggests that the size distribution
of a stem cell population bears signatures that are useful to detect negative
feedback mediated via volume exclusion.

Maintenance and regeneration of adult tissues rely on
the self-renewal of stem cells. Regeneration without
over-proliferation requires precise regulation of the
stem cell proliferation and differentiation rates. The
nature of such regulatory mechanisms in different
tissues, and how to incorporate them in models
of stem cell population dynamics, is incompletely
understood. The critical birth-death (CBD) process
is widely used to model stem cell populations,
capturing key phenomena, such as scaling laws in
clone size distributions. However, the CBD process
neglects regulatory mechanisms. Here, we propose
the birth-death process with volume exclusion (vBD),
a variation of the birth-death process that considers
crowding effects, such as may arise due to limited
space in a stem cell niche. While the deterministic rate
equations predict a single non-trivial attracting steady
state, the master equation predicts extinction and
transient distributions of stem cell numbers with three
possible behaviours: long-lived quasi-steady state,
and short-lived bimodal or unimodal distributions.
In all cases, we approximate solutions to the vBD
master equation using a renormalized system-size

Stem cells (SCs) are a population of cells capable of self-renewing and differentiating into all the
cells in a particular lineage. In adult tissue homeostasis, SCs slowly self-renew and differentiate
to compensate for the death of other cells while maintaining a constant average population size
[1–4]. Upon injury, however, the SC proliferation and differentiation rates increase dramatically to
repair the tissue, only settling back into homeostasis when regeneration is completed [5–7]. Such
tight control over the SC proliferation and differentiation rates requires regulatory mechanisms
providing feedback to the SCs.
Against the backdrop of recent advances in experimental techniques in stem cell biology, a
broad range of SC regulatory mechanisms have been reported, such as negative feedback exerted
by the more differentiated cells [6–8], competition between SCs for fate determinants [9,10], or
mechanical feedback [11–13]. An additional plausible mechanism stems from the conﬁnement of
SCs to a particular microenvironment, the stem cell niche [9,14–16]. This microenvironment plays
a key role in maintaining cell stemness and promoting SC quiescence [17–19], self-renewal, or
differentiation, according to tissue requirements; however, it also triggers a competition between
SCs for niche access [10,20,21].
Crowding effects are often associated with volume exclusion [22–26]. The non-negligible
volume of particles restricts their movement, thus obstructing their access to available free space
[22]. As a consequence, the accessible phase space can be greatly reduced. If cells are dividing
without reducing their size, crowding effects can have an impact on the SC proliferation and
death (or differentiation) rates. For example, a proliferation event reduces the available space,
which in turn reduces the proliferation rate, thus creating a negative feedback loop. Volume
exclusion has been also suggested to play a role in the regulation of cancer stem cells and tumour
growth [27]. However, it is not yet clear how to distinguish between crowding effects and other
regulatory mechanisms from observations of the population evolution (e.g. from snapshots of the
SC population at different times).
Stem cell division and differentiation has been previously modelled stochastically by the
simple chemical reaction network S!2S,S!; [1,28], where differentiation is equivalent to
death if differentiated progeny do not self-renew. To prevent the population from diverging or
vanishing, the birth and death rates must be equal, thus obtaining a critical birth-death process
(CBD). For stem cell population dynamics, the CBD process has been frequently treated under
well-mixed and dilute gas conditions, which facilitate its computational implementation, e.g.,
Gillespie algorithm, [29,30] and mathematical analysis through the master equation formalism
[31,32]. This approach has been successfully employed to illustrate key features of SC populations,
such as population asymmetry (the maintenance of a constant average population via symmetric
divisions that are balanced at the population level, instead of asymmetric divisions), neutral
competition [1,28,33], and scaling properties of clone size distributions [28,33–35]. However, the
CBD ignores the ﬁnite-size nature of cells and thus disregards the role of available space in cell
division.
Here, we present a modiﬁcation of the birth-death process that includes competition for niche
access, the birth-death process with volume exclusion (vBD). We subdivide the space within a
niche intoNvoxels (small volumes of space); each voxel is either occupied by a stem cell or else
is empty. Assuming well-mixed conditions, the effective chemical reaction network describing
this process is S+E!2S,S!E, whereSandEdescribe stem cells and empty voxels in the
niche, respectively. The ﬁrst reaction reﬂects the need for a stem cell to ﬁnd an empty voxel to
divide, while the second one represents the birth of an empty voxel after stem cell death or
differentiation (assuming differentiated progeny leave the niche space). Naturally the system
obeys the conservation law nS+nE=N, whereNis the niche carrying capacity, and nS,nEare
the number of stem cells and empty voxels, respectively. Note that the vBD resembles a stochastic
SIS model, with the number of infectious given by the species S, and susceptible by E. However,
while the SIS model is usually treated for N!1 , we are interested in the low Nbehaviour.3rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .In terms of the vBD model parameters, the basic reproduction number for the equivalent SIS
model is given by R0=Nk1=k2, wherek1andk2are the rates of proliferation and differentiation,
respectively. The deterministic rate equations for the vBD process predict a logistic convergence
to a non-trivial attracting steady state. From a microscopic perspective (i.e. the master equation’s
solutions), however, this prediction is not realised, and the vBD process relaxes to extinction,
irrespective of the parameter values and initial conditions.
Our analysis reveals the three different behaviours of the stochastic vBD process that are
absent in its deterministic counterpart. When the birth rate is much larger than the death rate,
the system quickly takes the form of a long-lived, quasi-steady state, and very slowly relaxes
to extinction through a transient bimodal distribution. Conversely, for death rates much larger
than the birth rates, the system quickly converges to extinction through a unimodal transient.
Lastly, when the birth and death rates are comparable, the transient distribution is bimodal but
the convergence to extinction is fast. For these three different parameter regimes, we approximate
the solution of the vBD master equation using a quasi-stationary approximation, a renormalized
system-size expansion (including ﬁnite size corrections to the linear-noise approximation), and
the WKB method. In particular, the renormalized system-size expansion is a recent modiﬁcation
of the original van Kampen’s SSE that has not been widely used yet, but proves useful for
tackling master equations of non-linear birth-death processes. Finally, we derive an expression
for the expected extinction time, based on Kolmogorov’s backward equation and ﬁrst-passage
time theory. Our analytical solutions provide insights into the rich behaviours of the vBD model.

is the initial condition, and we can appreciate that !1    !when06= 0 (Fig. 1 B). In this
deterministic system, the extinction state = 0is never reached unless (0) = 0 .
The stochastic behaviour of the vBD differs from the deterministic predictions. Trajectories of
the vBD generated using the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA [29]) ﬂuctuate in the vicinity of
the deterministic steady state for some ﬁnite period of time (Fig. 1 B), but ﬂuctuations eventually
drive the stem cell number to extinction. The ensemble average of stochastic trajectories thus
converges to zero (see blue line in Fig. 1 B), disagreeing with the deterministic model’s prediction.
A stochastic treatment of the vBD process is provided by its chemical master equation,
i.e., Kolmogorov’s forward equation. The chemical master equation (CME) describes the time-
evolution of the probability that the system is in one of its states [31,36–38]. To construct the CME,
we ﬁrst note that the vBD model only involves reactions that increase or reduce the number
of stem cells by one unit. Hence the stochastic process underlying the reaction network (2.1)
takes the form of the Markov chain depicted in Fig. 2 A, where the states 0;1;:::;N represent
the number of stem cells. Note that the vBD process features a reﬂecting boundary at n=Nand
an absorbing boundary at n= 0. The propensities are determined by the law of mass-action and4rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Figure 1. The vBD model and its deterministic approximation. AStem cells (solid circles) move randomly in the niche
(grid) by switching position with empty voxels (dashed, empty circles). At any time a stem cell can “react” with a
neighbouring empty voxel to create two stem cells (cell division), and a single stem cell can differentiate or die, leaving a
new empty voxel in return. The propensities follow mass-action kinetics. BUnder well-mixed conditions, the deterministic
approximation predicts the evolution of the mean stem cell concentration satisfying the logistic equation (2.2) , thus
portraying a logistic convergence to the average stem cell number N(black line). Stochastic trajectories (green and
orange lines) obtained by the SSA, however, are driven to the extinction state by ﬂuctuations. The ensemble average
(blue line) of 2104stochastic trajectories reveals the eventual distinction–in contrast to the deterministic prediction of
a non-zero steady state.

The solution of the master equation, for an initial probability distribution P(0), is given by
P() =eMP(0). The main properties of the solution are captured by the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues ofM. It is easy to prove that 0= 0 is always an eigenvalue associated with
the eigenvector [1;0;:::; 0]T(the extinction state), while the other eigenvalues are real and
negative [39]. Therefore, the extinction state is always reached, irrespective of the parameter
values and initial conditions. Moreover, the expected extinction time is the inverse of the spectral
gap,j1 0j 1, where1is the smallest (in absolute value) non-zero eigenvalue.

spectral gap of the reduced system obtained by eliminating the extinction state (orange line in
Fig. 2 B) – we observe that the smallest gap is 22:61which is achieved in the limit of small
. Hence, after an initial transient the PDF is dominated by the eigenvectors associated with 0

where e0= [1;0;:::; 0]Tis the extinction state, and e1= [ 1;f(1);f(2);:::;f (N)]Tis the leading

(ii)P(0;) = 1 e 1. Note that f(n)is the PDF of stem cell numbers conditioned on non-

where the operator ~Mresults from eliminating the ﬁrst row and column of M. Note that, even
though the steady state in the original CME is the extinction state, the CME for the surviving
trajectories presents a non-trivial steady state (Fig. 2 C-E). In effect, the steady state of Eq. (2.9)
yields the entries f(k)ofe1.
Numerical experiments reveal the presence of three different behaviours in the solution given
by Eq. (2.6). For high values the system relaxes to a long-lived quasi-steady state, f(n), before
slowly relaxing again to extinction through a transient bimodal distribution (Fig. 2 C). The two
modes given by the eigenstates e0ande1in Eq. (2.6) are located at the extinction state and near
(but not necessarily at) N, respectively. The leading eigenvalue vanishes for high (blue line
in Fig. 2 B), indicating the presence of a quasi-steady state (QSS). For intermediate values,
the transient bimodality is still present, but the relaxation to extinction is faster than the time to
reach the QSS (Fig. 2 D). For lowvalues the system rapidly goes extinct, and the mode around
Nis absent (Fig 2 E). The phase diagram in Fig. 2 Fsummarises the three types of behaviour
of the vBD model as a function of and the carrying capacity N. To determine the parameter
regimes for these three behaviours, we compute numerically the solution to the master equation,
P() =eMP(0), choosingP(n;0) =nk, whereijis the Kronecker delta and k=dNe. We
then extract the PDF conditioned on non-extinction after the initial transient. The black region in
Fig. 2 Fcorresponds to the case in which such distribution does not present maximum for n>1. To
distinguish between the bimodal extinction and QSS regions, we compute numerically the second
eigenvalue ofM,1, and set a tolerance = 110 2. The grey region in Fig. 2 Fcorresponds to
1>, and the white region to 1. In the next two sections we derive approximate solutions
forf(n)andTin the three different regimes.
3. Approximate solutions
Here, we present approximate solutions for the vBD master equation. From Eq. (2.6), it follows
that the solution adopts the form P(n;) =f(n)e 1,8n1, andP(0;) = 1 e 1. Hence,
the asymptotic solution is determined by the PDF conditioned on non-extinction, f(n), and the
inverse of the expected extinction time, 1. In this section we tackle the problem of approximating6rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Eqs. (3.3) and (3.4) are exact solutions for the post-transient dynamics given by Eq. (2.6). However,
the slow convergence of the continued fraction and the difﬁculty in applying truncation methods
render Eqs. (3.3) and (3.4) unsuitable for the analysis of the system’s dynamics. On the other hand,
the continued fraction solution offers a fast computational estimation for the master equation’s
time-dependent solution, often less demanding than direct matrix exponentiation to estimate
P(n;) =eMP(0). In what follows, we derive three different approximate solutions to the
master equation of the vBD process, one for each region of the phase diagram shown in Fig. 2 F.
(a) QSS approximation
For highvalues,11and correspondingly the mean extinction time is very large (see
Fig. 1 B). Since1=b0f(1), we can impose a quasi-steady state condition by disregarding the
second term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (2.9), leading to @~P=@~M~P. The steady state of the CME
conditioned on non-extinction can be obtained by solving ~M~P= 0; theNthrow yielding f(N 

where ^ai=ai+i2b0, andi2is the Kronecker delta. Finally to ﬁnd f(N)we make use of the

nto adopt real values, (N)24N(1 ), which is the case for all parameter sets in the QSS
region. Hence, in general the position of the non-zero mode differs from the deterministic model’s
prediction, i.e., n+6=N. As an example, for a carrying capacity of N= 100 and= 0:4, then
n+38. Note that, when !1orN!1 ,n+!Nandn !0. Thus in these limits, the
distribution has a single mode sitting at the deterministic model’s prediction of the mean stem
cell number.
(b) Renormalized system size expansion
For parameter sets (;N)in the bimodal and unimodal extinction regions (grey and black areas
in Fig. 2 F), the QSS approximation is unable to capture the PDF conditioned on non-extinction
(as it can be seen in Figs. 3 B, C and 4 A). In such cases, the condition 11does not hold, and
hence the second term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (2.9) can no longer be considered negligible (which is
needed to ﬁnd the steady state of the CME conditioned on non-extinction iteratively, as we did
in the QSS case). Hence a different approximation is needed. In what follows we derive a new
approximate PDF conditioned on non-extinction based on a high-order renormalized system size
expansion of the vBD’s master equation. In section i we provide a general analytical recipe to
obtain an expression for the PDF conditioned on non-extinction, Eqs. (3.20) and (3.21) being the
main results. While self-contained, this derivation is mathematically lengthy, and the reader can
skip it should they be solely interested in its application to the vBD process. We point the reader
to [40] for a detailed derivation of the method. In section ii we apply the renormalized SSE results
to the vBD system, and obtain an analytical expression for the PDF conditioned on non-extinction.
(i) Derivation of the renormalized SSE formula
The van Kampen system size expansion (SSE) approximates a master equation by splitting the
random variable that describes the stem cell number, n, into deterministic and non-deterministic
components, to then obtain a master equation for the non-deterministic components (usually
taken as a continuous random variable). The resultant CME can be expanded in powers of N 1=2,
truncated to a desired order and solved, leading to a hierarchy of approximate solutions [41].
Whilst the bulk of applications are centred in truncating the CME after the order N0to obtain
the linear noise approximation (LNA), which considers the particle concentration equal to its
deterministic value, other works have used higher order truncation schemes to obtain corrections
to the mean concentration [42,43]. The deterministic component is commonly assumed to be given
by the solution of the rate equations. However, the disagreement between the deterministic and
stochastic predictions (see Fig. 1 B) makes it sensible to introduce a correction term to the mean
stem cell concentration in the original ansatz. To do so, we follow the procedure from [40], that
starts by considering the ansatz
n
N=+N 1=2hi+N 1=2^; (3.10)
where the ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. is the zero-order mean stem cell concentration obtained from
the deterministic rate equations, the second term is a correction to the mean concentration due
to ﬂuctuations, and the third term in the r.h.s. represents ﬂuctuations about the corrected mean
concentration. This renormalization of the mean concentration leads to a different system-size9rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .expansion than the conventional one by van Kampen, which we refer to as the renormalized

To summarise, the system size expansion procedure involves expanding the master
equation for the ﬂuctuations about the mean concentration (assuming the ﬂuctuations are a10rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .continuous random variable) in powers of N 1=2, and truncating after O(N0)to obtain a
Fokker-Planck equation that yields the LNA, thus describing Gaussian ﬂuctuations around
the mean concentration. The higher order approximate solutions can then be expressed in
terms of the ﬁrst-order approximation. However, this approach often leads to non-physically
meaningful distributions for truncations of the system-size expansion beyond the LNA level of
approximation, e.g., yielding negative probabilities or oscillatory behaviour. Such effects can be
greatly reduced by introducing a discrete formulation of the SSE’s approximate solutions [40].
The discrete formulation replaces the continuous-variable LNA approximate solution, by the

We now employ the renormalized discrete-formulation of the system size expansion to
approximate the probability distributions conditioned on non-extinction in the bimodal extinction
region, i.e., the grey zone in Fig. 2 F. To do so, we observe that the absorbing boundary, which is
the factor that renders the deterministic rate equations inaccurate for calculating the evolution
of the mean stem cell number, is absent when conditioning on non-extinction. In effect, the rate
equations capture meaningful information about the mean stem cell number of the surviving
stochastic trajectories. Thus, to approximate the steady states of Eq. (2.9) we can apply the
renormalized system size expansion described in the previous subsection, under stationary
conditions, to the non-conditional master equation (2.5), which includes the extinction state.
We then recover the PDF conditioned on non-extinction by removing the extinction state and
multiplying the resulting distribution by a normalization constant 1=(1 P(0)), whereP(0)is
the probability of being in the extinction state obtained by the SSE. In particular, to capture
non-Gaussian ﬂuctuations, we truncate the renormalized SSE after terms of O(N 1).

The renormalized SSE accurately describes the probability conditioned on non-extinction for
in the QSS region (Figure 3 A), as well as in the fast bimodal extinction region (Fig. 3 B),
where the QSS approximation breaks down, and accurately captures the distribution skewness.
Moreover, this result is robust to changes in the carrying capacity (Fig. 4 B). However, the accuracy
of the renormalized SSE decreases dramatically for very low values, as it can be seen in Fig. 3 C.
For non-linear birth-death processes featuring non-Gaussian ﬂuctuations, the renormalized SSE
consistently performs better than the LNA, which is unable to capture the distribution skewness
under stationary conditions.
(iii) Approximation for low values
The phases with extinction through a bimodal and unimodal transient are separated by a critical
curve, which also accurately demarcates the regions of parameter space where the renormalized
SSE expansion is accurate and where it is not (see Fig. 4 B). We attribute the inaccuracy of the SSE
in the lowregion to the fact that the PDF conditioned on non-extinction no longer features a
mode around N, which is the basis of the SSE approximations.
In the unimodal extinction region – black region in Fig. 2 F– the time-dependent probability
distribution features a mode at n= 0 as extinction is approached. This suggests that we can
approximate the cell number concentration by the steady-state of the deterministic equations, ,13rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

naturally arise from the conditioning of the distribution on non-extinction. Given the mode at

down for higher values, where the non-trivial mode is present (Fig. 3 BandD).

coincides with that of the QSS approximation (compare Figs. 4 Aand C). An advantage of the
WKB approximation stems from its simple analytical form. However the QSS approximation is
generally more accurate than the WKB approximation (see Fig. 3 D).16rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4. Calculation of the extinction time
In the previous section we have shown different approximations for the leading eigenvector of the
vBD model’s master equation solution, Eq. (2.6). The time-dependent component of the solution
is determined by the leading eigenvalue, 1, which is the inverse of the expected extinction
time. The most direct method for estimating this eigenvalue would be to calculate the probability
conditioned on non-extinction, f(n), and making use of Eq. (2.7) to yield 1=b0f(1). However,
the absorbing boundary at n= 0leads to an inaccurate estimation of the probability of having
n= 1 stem cells (using all approximation methods considered) and thus we cannot use this
method to estimate the extinction time (see Fig. 5 A). Hence, we present an alternative calculation
for the expected extinction time that is based on averaging the mean extinction time starting
from any state, and makes use of the Kolmogorov’s backward equation. This approach has been
effectively used for other similar problems (see for example [48,49]). Instead of relying solely
on the estimation of f(1), this method involves averaging among all the f(n)values, which
signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy with respect to direct application of 1=b0f(1).
Given an estimate for the probability distribution of the surviving trajectories, f(n), the
expected extinction time Tis simply the average among initial conditions of the mean ﬁrst passage
times to hit the extinction state

Q0;n(+) =an+1Q 0;n+1() +b0;n 1Q 0;n 1() + (1 an+1 bn 1)Q0;n();
(4.2)
whereQ0;n()is the probability of being extinct at time , given that initially there were n
cells. The backward equation just states that the total probability of becoming extinct from
statenat time+equals the probability of jumping to the state with n+ 1 cells and then
going extinct, plus the probability of jumping to state with n 1cells and then going extinct,
plus the probability of staying in the same state and going extinct. The probability density of
becoming extinct at time +isQ0;n(+) Q0;n(). Hence, the mean ﬁrst passage time
to extinction, starting from a state of ncells, reads

n=1X
k=0k[Q0;n(k) Q0;n((k 1))]: (4.3)
Here, we assume Q0;n( ) = 0 . To simplify the notation, let us denote with Qn()the
cumulative probability of becoming extinct at time given that the system started in state
withncells. Substituting +!in Eq. (4.2), we have Qn() =an+1Qn+1( ) +
bn 1Qn 1( ) + (1 (an+1+bn 1))Qn( ). Subtracting both expressions,
multiplying by =k and integrating over time (which in this case amounts to sum over all
k), leads to
1X
k=0k[Qn((k+ 1)) Qn(k)] =1X
k=0an+1k()2[Qn+1() Qn+1( )]+

We can rewrite the l.h.s. asP1
k=0(k 1)[Qn(k) Qn((k 1))] =n , where we
have used that Qn(t) = 08<0, and the normalization condition of the probability density. The

Naturally, the accuracy of the expected extinction time T(and its inverse, 1), is sensitive to the
accuracy of the approximate PDF conditioned on non-extinction, f(n). When calculating 1from
Eq. (4.1) and Eq. (4.8) (with f(n)estimated numerically), the result is in very good agreement
with1numerically calculated from the master operator’s eigenvalues (compare the orange and
black dashed lines in Figure 5 B). The approximate 1calculated using Eq. (4.8), where f(n)is
obtained using one of the approximations for the probability distribution conditioned on non-
extinction (Fig. 5 B), is much closer to its real value than 1calculated via Eq. (4.1) (Fig. 5 A).
For high, allf(n)approximations lead to accurate 1estimations, with the exception of the
half-Gaussian. On the other hand, the half-Gaussian approximation performs well for very low
, when every other approximation of f(n)yields inaccurate 1estimations. In the intermediate
region, the renormalized-system size expansion turns out to be the best choice.
Extinction times vary signiﬁcantly between parameter regimes, which we can think of as
corresponding to different stem cell niches. Assuming that the system is in quasi-steady state, the
average number of stem cells is roughly given by hniN. Hence, given the average number of
stem cells in a niche, we can estimate the effective carrying capacity for different values from
the quasi-steady state parameter regime. For example, for adult human crypt stem cell niches
harbouring 4 6cells with division period of 24 30h[50,51], the extinction times fall between
13days and 50years when comparing the results for different values spanning all the quasi-
steady state region. A predicted extinction time on this scale could point to the need of additional
regulatory mechanisms preventing extinction of a tissue’s stem cell population within the lifetime
of an organism. For slow-cycling stem cells such as haematopoietic stem cells, the lowest estimates
yield the presence of 104cells dividing once every 40weeks [52]. More recent estimates point to
the number of hematopoietic stem cells in the human body falling within 5104 2105[53].
It is unclear how these stem cells are distributed in individual niches, but even for niches hosting
100 stem cells the extinction times fall within 1011 1013years, much higher than the human
lifetime. For niches hosting a larger number of stem cells the extinction time is even higher.
5. Discussion and Conclusion
We have introduced the birth-death process with volume exclusion, a variation of the birth-
death process that incorporates crowding effects due to the ﬁnite size of stem cell niches. For18rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

master operator. The 1estimation via Eq. (4.1) with f(n)calculated numerically (labelled “Theo”, orange line) is in good
agreement with the exact 1. For very low , Eq. (4.1) with the half Gaussian approximation is the best ﬁt, while for
higherthe SSE performs better. For high all approximations except the half Gaussian lead to good estimates of
1. The application of Eq. (4.1) outperforms the direct approximation of 1using Eq. (2.7) (contrast panels AandB).
cell division to occur there needs to be free space in the niche to accommodate the new born cell –
hence the effective proliferation rate is higher (lower) when the niche is less (more) populated. In
effect, the expected stem cell number in the vBD model is independent of the initial condition,
in contrast to the CBD case, in which the expected number of stem cells is constant in time.
Regulation through volume exclusion could also affect clone size distributions and their scaling
with average clone size. In contrast to the CBD process, in which the size evolution of different
clones is independent, in the vBD all clones are coupled through the empty space species. When
one clone grows in size, the probability of other clones growing is decreased, thus affecting
the clone-size distribution. Hence, it might be possible to detect evidence of volume exclusion
effects from snapshots of clone size distributions, which are commonly measured experimentally
[54–57]. We will explore this in follow-up research.
At the stochastic level, the predictions of the vBD master equation differ signiﬁcantly from
those of its deterministic counterpart. While the deterministic rate equations feature a stable
steady state, , to which the system converges logistically, the master equation’s solution predicts
the vBD model converging to extinction for all parameter sets. However, for sufﬁciently large,
a long-lived quasi-steady state appears, and convergence to extinction is very slow. Hence, for
high, a single stochastic trajectory representing a real system, might ﬂuctuate around the
quasi-steady state’s non-trivial mode for all its lifetime.
We have shown the vBD model to have three phases with different behaviours that, to the best
of our knowledge, have not been analysed before: fast extinction dynamics through a unimodal
transient, fast extinction dynamics through a bimodal transient, and slow extinction dynamics
with a quasi-steady state. Transient bimodality rarely occurs in chemical reaction networks, but
has been reported in recent works [58,59]. For the quasi-steady state region, we have shown two
independent approximate solutions to the master equation, the QSS and WKB approximations.
The QSS provides a more accurate approximation, whilst the WKB adopts a simpler mathematical
expression. Moreover, the QSS approximation allowed us to prove that the position of the non-
trivial mode generally differs from the deterministic prediction. For the bimodal extinction region,
we have derived an approximate time-dependent solution to the master equation by making19rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .use of a renormalized system-size expansion, which is particularly useful for solving master
equations of non-linear birth-death processes, but has not been widely applied. Remarkably, the
expression obtained by the renormalized SSE is simpler than the one from the regular SSE.
The vBD model is mathematically similar to susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models in
epidemiology [60–63]. Most of the stochastic SIS models studies consider a very large carrying
capacity, or let it tend to inﬁnity. Here we have instead focused on solving the master equation
for low carrying capacities, motivated by the application to stem cell population dynamics in
niches that can have a carrying capacity as low as few tens of cells. The approximate solutions to
the master equations we present here, thus, can shed light into the behaviour of SIS-like systems
when the effect of having a ﬁnite carrying capacity becomes evident. In particular, the solutions
of the vBD master equation can be interpreted as the time-dependent PDF of the number of
infected individuals, and our approximation of the expected extinction time as the population’s
expected time to recovery. Another similar model can be found when studying the role of positive
feedback in cluster formation of signalling molecules [64]. In this case, the transition from quasi-
steady to extinction states are interpreted as a switch from clustered to non-clustered states. A
difference between such model and the vBD is that transitions to non-clustered to clustered states
are allowed, whilst in the vBD model it is not possible to exit the extinction state.
Our study proposes and describes a minimal model for stem cell dynamics with regulation
through competition for space. In this context, the system parameters should be taken as effective
parameters encompassing many different features. Let us conclude by discussing aspects of
biological realism that could be represented explicitly in future extensions of our model. The
vBD model assumes Markovian dynamics, which implies exponentially distributed waiting
times between consecutive cell divisions. There is increasing evidence showing that the cell-
cycle times are not exponentially distributed [65–69]. The inclusion of realistic cell-cycle time
distributions in the vBD model will require further research. Spatially, our model considers cells
distributed on a grid, assuming that the cell shapes remain unaltered. This hypothesis ignores the
mechanical plasticity of cells, their mechanical response to pressure in different environments,
and the irregular geometry of the stem cell niches [16,70]. Moreover, here we have modelled cell
populations as well-mixed systems. This well-mixing assumption may be inappropriate when a
niche is highly occupied. Since our aim is to study the hallmarks of regulation through volume
exclusion, we have also neglected other plausible regulatory mechanisms that might be acting in
parallel, such as competition for other resources [10,71,72] or cell-cell communication pathways
between more differentiated (for example, transit amplifying) cells and stem cells [6,73]. In open
niches these more differentiated cells might also compete with stem cells for space [10,72,74,75].
The role of multiple cell types in competition for space and the interaction between different
plausible regulatory mechanisms are interesting avenues for future research.20rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .References
