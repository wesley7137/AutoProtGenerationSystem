Title: Incubation periods under various anti-retroviral therapies in
  homogeneous mixing and age-structured dynamical models: A theoretical
  approach
Abstract:   With the launch of second line anti-retroviral therapy for HIV infected
individuals, there has been an increased expectation on surviving period of
people with HIV. We consider previously well-known models in HIV epidemiology
where the parameter for incubation period is used as one of the important
components to explain the dynamics of the variables. Such models are extended
here to explain the dynamics with respect to a given therapy that prolongs life
of an HIV infected individual. A deconvolution method is demonstrated for
estimation of parameters in the situations when no-therapy and multiple
therapies are given to the infected population. The models and deconvolution
method are extended in order to study the impact of therapy in age-structured
populations. A generalization for a situation when n-types of therapies are
available is given. Models are demonstrated using hypothetical data and
sensitivity of the parameters are also computed.

1.Preliminaries, Basic ODE Model and
Integro-Differential Equations models
With the introduction of second line therapy[53] to the peop le living with
HIV who were already on ﬁrst line therapy until introduction of second line
therapy, there is a further hope to increase the active life o f HIV infected indi-
viduals. Revised estimates of the people living with HIV are obtained for some
countries to address the impact of second line therapy (see, for example[49]).
Second line theory is provided after failure to responding t o the ﬁrst line
therapy among the infected individuals. Modeling the impac t of second line
therapy and corresponding extended survival time is compli cated because sus-
ceptible population can acquire virus from two infected cla ss of populations
who are on therapy in addition to the infected population who are without
any therapy. However identifying the ﬁrst line individuals who are no more
responding to the ﬁrst line therapy through surveillance is still a challenging
issue in several countries. Diﬃculties in monitoring and re cording HIV in-
fected population who are on ﬁrst line and second line therap y will also lead
to diﬃculty in estimating parameters of disease progressio n and disease re-
lated mortalities. Disease progression rate and incubatio n period are related
and usually both are taken as reciprocal to each other. Incub ation period of
HIV infected individuals is also expected to increase since new anti-retroviral
therapy policies. The incubation period is generally deﬁne d as ‘the time du-
ration between the time a virus or bacteria enters the human b ody and the
time at which clinical clinical symptoms occur’. This durat ion can vary from
case to case depending upon the route through which the virus or bacteria
enters the immune system of an individual and in some cases de pends upon
the age of the infected individual. For chickenpox this dura tion is 10 - 21 days,
for common cold 2 - 5 days, for mumps 12 to 25 days, for SARS a max imum
of up to 10 days, for rubella 14 - 21 days, for pertussis 7 - 10 da ys, and forINCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 4
HIV infection to AIDS 6 months to 10 years or more. The incubat ion pe-
riod can be used as a measure of rapidity of the illness after i nteraction with
the virus or bacteria. It is not easy to collect information o n the incubation
period of infected individuals unless they are monitored. O ne of the direct
ways of estimating the average incubation period of a given v irus in the pop-
ulation is by surveillance and followup of the infected indi viduals until they
develop symptoms. All the infected individuals may not be aw are of their
infection until symptoms appear and followup is subject to t he availability of
an individual. It might not be possible to follow up individu als in a typical
situation, where time taken for the onset of symptoms from th e infection is
longer, especially if infected individuals are lost to foll owup. Hence, there are
limitations on directly estimating the average incubation period from prospec-
tive cohort studies. Nevertheless, the incubation period o ccupies an important
role along with other parameters in modeling the disease spr ead and under-
standing the basic reproductive rate. A useful description of various epidemic
models, and of estimation of parameters like the incubation period, transmis-
sion rates, forces of infections are presented in [3]. The de gree of importance
of obtaining accurate average incubation periods varies wi th the incubation
period of the disease. This degree of variation causes mathe matical models
to act sensitively in predicting future burden. Models desc ribing dynamics
of disease spread where the incubation period is shorter are less subject for
producing misleading results than models for the spread wit h longer and vary-
ing incubation periods. Especially for predicting AIDS, th e epidemic models
developed, depend heavily on parameters that determine tra nsmission rates of
infection from infected to susceptible and on the parameter which explains the
average time to progress to AIDS. A review of various modelin g approaches
and quantitative techniques to estimate the incubation per iod can be found
in [8, 6]. The introduction of anti-retroviral therapies an d protease inhibitors
during the 1990s in several parts of the world resulted decli ne in opportunis-
tic infections related to AIDS [41, 9, 11]. As a result of such interventions,
the average incubation period was prolonged. There have bee n attempts to
estimate the incubation period that vary due to drug interve ntion using statis-
tical density functions [4]. The impact of this variation on the HIV dynamics,
stability and on basic reproduction number has been investi gated [8, 12, 20].
In this section, we ﬁrst consider an ODE model that explains t he dynamics
of HIV spread in a population leading to AIDS (see [13]). We th en consider
a similar model where incubation period is a variable with re spect to a given
therapy. We address issues of estimating incubation period to be used in such
dynamical models and the impact of above mentioned therapie s. Various ideas
and the outline of this work are given at the end of this sectio n.INCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 5
Perhaps the most fundamental model for the epidemiology of A IDS is that
given by [13, 2, 3], which takes the form
dX
dt= Λ−(λ+µ)X,
dY
dt=λX−(d+µ)Y, (1.1)
dDz
dt=dY−γDz.
Here the total population ( N) is divided into susceptibles ( X), infectives
(Y) and individuals with the full blown disease ( Dz). The parameter Λis the
input into the susceptible class, which can be deﬁned as the n umber of births
in the population, λis the force of infection, µis general (non-AIDS related)
mortality, γis disease related mortality and 1/dis the average incubation
period. Here the incubation period is deﬁned as the duration of time between
infection and onset of full blown disease. There are several other constructions
of HIV transmission dynamics models
In the models involving the disease progression parameter, it has been as-
sumed that there is an increase in the mean length of life afte r HIV infection
since the availability of therapies for AIDS [37, 38]. There are several works
describing the impact of anti-retroviral therapies using d ata [1, 21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43] and through models
[23, 38, 42, 44, 45]. The time to start ART based on the CD4 coun t is still
debatable. In a recent study on HIV-1 discordant couples [46 ], it was observed
that the incidence rates among early ART couples are lower th an than the inci-
dence rates among couples who were given ART at a standard tim e. Drugs are
available which cannot eliminate virus from the body, but ar e helpful in pro-
longing the life of an individual by slowing the disease prog ression (in other
words increasing the incubation period). For example, prot ease inhibitors
(saydrug 1) facilitate in producing non-infectious virus (only infect ious virus
participates in new virus production), hence slowing the di sease progression;
anti-retroviral therapy ( say drug 2) blocks virus from interacting with the
non-infected cells and hence reduces the infection process within the cell pop-
ulation (see section 5 in [14] and [15] for fuller details); a nd a combination
of the above two drugs ( say drug 3 ) can be more eﬀective by simultaneously
combining the function of drug 1 anddrug 2. Note that, when model (1.1)
was developed, the above described drugs were not available . Information on
scale-up of anti-retroviral therapies and related monitor ing of individuals can
be found elsewhere (for example, see [23, 50, 47, 51]. We assu me that once
individuals start taking drugs, their average incubation p eriod is prolonged.
So, instead of assuming a constant 1/d, we assume that it varies based on theINCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 6

Estimation of parameters for the varying incubation period s is important
for understanding the impact of drugs in prolonging the onse t of disease and
thus to prolong the life. The set Bwill also be useful in obtaining vary-
ing basic reproductive rates, R0ifor alli= 0,1,2,3. This can be computed
asR0i=λγi/integraltext
RzidG(zi)by assuming independence of the impact of various
drugs. So far, there is no evidence that β,the probability of infecting a suscep-
tible partner changes with the activation of a drug in the bod y. If we assume
this as a constant, then R00≥R01≥or< R02≥R03. R01<{R01,R02,R03},INCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 8
because individuals are assumed to have longer incubation p eriod due to the ef-
fect of drugs. In the absence of clinical evidence, we assume that the impact of
drug1 anddrug2 follows any one of the following relations:/integraltext
Rz1dG(z1)≤or>/integraltext
Rz2dG(z2).Similarly, another important epidemiological measure, th e dou-
bling time, tdiis obtained as tdi= ln(2)/integraltext
RzidG(zi)/[R0i−1].Anti-retroviral
therapy helps in blocking the virus from interacting with ce lls and simulta-
neously providing protease inhibitors helps in producing n on-infectious virus.
So without loss of generality, it is assumed that the impact o f double drug
therapy is better than a single drug therapy. If we assume dis ease related
mortality is constant for all ithenγi=γ.The number of AIDS related deaths
in general are high during latter part of the incubation peri od due to increase
in opportunistic infections. In general, over all AIDS rela ted mortality rate in
a population is assumed to be higher than the general mortali ty rate in that
population. Where there are ntypes of drugs available, we write the general
form for the above dynamical model as follows:

As a special case we can consider all the parameters in the abo ve model
as Stieltjes integrals and can estimate them using the rigor ous procedure ex-
plained in the next section. For n= 3in the model (1.4), we can deduce the
model (1.3). Practically, we do not have a situation where se veral drugs areINCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 9
available in the market for HIV infected individuals. Hence , the model (1.4)
should be treated as a theoretical generalization.
This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we present c ontemporary
models constructed for understanding transmission dynami cs of HIV for policy
formulations and corresponding modiﬁed disease progressi on component that
captures the impact of therapy, in section 3, we describe in d etail the esti-
mation of the set Bfor up to three drugs; section 4 gives the corresponding
expressions for the conditional probabilities of N−drugs. We construct the-
oretical examples using three functions: Gamma, Logistic a nd Log-normal in
section 5 to demonstrate the method explained in section 3. I n section 6 anal-
ysis for age-structured populations is described in detail . Overall conclusions
are given in section 7. Appendix I gives equations for condit ional probability
when incubation period for various drug types does not have t he monotonicity
property. Appendix II gives some more theoretical examples when the incuba-
tion period is truncated to the right. Appendix III provides parameter values
adopted for numerical simulations and Appendix IV has numer ical demonstra-
tion of the model outputs and sensitivity of parameters in pr ojecting HIV and
AIDS.
2.Contemporary models and Modifications
In this section, we present a contemporary model for HIV epid emic in India
[19] and corresponding integro-diﬀerential equations. HI V model [19] devel-
oped based on Indian data has three components, 1) Model for s pread in
general population, 2) model for spread in homosexual men (M SM), 3) model
for spread in intravenous drug users (IDU). We provide a desc ription of this
model and then write corresponding revised model with integ ro diﬀerential
equations. The system of diﬀerential equations in three mod els have incorpo-
rated dynamics in fourteen compartments: U(i),susceptible population; V(i),
sexually transmitted diseases population; W(i),HIV infected; T(i),AIDS in
the general population for gender i(say,i= 1for male and i= 2for female),
U(m),susceptible MSM; V(m),sexually transmitted infected MSM;, W(m),
HIV infected MSM; T(m),MSM population with AIDS; U(IDU),suscepti-
ble intravenous drug users; W(IDU),HIV infected intravenous drug users;
T(IDU),intravenous drug users with AIDS. Male susceptible in gener al pop-
ulation is eligible to acquire virus from jth sub-population ( j= 1,female
married partner; j= 2,female casual partner, j= 3,commercial sex worker;
j= 4,through blood transfusions. All the sub-populations are al lowed to
contribute for the transmission dynamics of HIV and each sub -population is
also subject to the risk of acquiring the infection from othe r sub-population
wherever applicable (see [19] for complete description).

3.Conditional probabilities
In this section, we will give a detailed procedure to estimat eBthrough a
deconvolution technique. Let Bbe split into a collection of four parameter
sets say, B={B0,B1,B2,B3}for the four types of scenarios described in the
previous section. Let Hbe the time of infection and Zbe the incubation
period, then the time of onset of the disease can be represent ed asD=H+Z.
There have been studies (see for list of references Brookmey er and Gail (1994)),
in which HandZwere assumed independent and Dwas estimated through
convolution. We outline the general idea of convolution and then give the
convolution of HandZ.Suppose (an)and(bn)are two sequences of numbers
over the time period, then
(an)∗(bn) =n/summationdisplay
k=0anbn−k (3.1)
where(an)∗(bn)is the convolution of these sequences with an operator′∗′.
Suppose aandbare mutually independent random variables and let AL(x)
andBL(x)be their Laplace transformations, then a+bhas the Laplace trans-
formation ALBL.Since the multiplication of the Laplace transformation is
associative and commutative, it follows that (an)∗(bn)is also associative and
commutative. Instead of discrete notation, suppose aandbare continuous
and independent with probability density functions handg, then the density
ofh+gis given by
f(s) =/integraldisplay∞
−∞h(t−s)g(t)dt=/integraldisplay∞
−∞h(t)g(t−s)ds
.
Suppose G(s) =/integraltexts
−∞g(s)ds, andF(s) =/integraltexts
−∞f(s)dsthen
F(s) =/integraldisplay∞
−∞h(t)G(t−s)ds. (3.2)
We callFthe convolution of handG. Suppose the above handGrepresent
the infection density and incubation period distribution f unction; then the
convolution of handGrepresents the cumulative number of disease cases
reported (or observed), and is given by
h∗G=/integraldisplay∞
−∞h(t)G(t−s)ds. (3.3)
This kind of convolution in (3.3) was used to estimate the num ber of AIDS
cases for the ﬁrst time by [7]. Information on Gmay not be available for someINCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 15
populations. In such situations, Ghas been estimated through deconvolution
from the information available on h∗Gandh[16, 17]. In this section we will
construct conditional probabilities for each drug type and express the function
that maximizes B. These kind of conditional probabilities derived for the
drug type were not available earlier for the incubation periods when t he total
number of reported disease cases were considered. Note that h∗Gis the
cumulative number of disease cases.
LetX0,X1,X2,...,X n−k,...,X n−l,...,X n−m,...,X nbe the disease cases avail-
able in the time intervals [Ui−1,Ui)fori= 0,1,2,...n−k,...n−l,...(n−m)+
1,...n+1.Suppose Eis the event of diagnosis of disease after the ﬁrst infection
atT0.LetE={E0,E1,E2,E3}andE0occurs in the interval [U0,Un−k),E1
(orE2) in[Un−k,Un−l)(or[Un−l,Un−m)) andE3in[Un−m,Un).NowD,the
cumulative number of disease cases up to time Un,can be expressed from (3.3)
as follows:
D(U0≤s≤Un) =/integraldisplayUn−k

In the above equation A0,A1, A2andA3are the parameter sets for the hfor
drug0,drug1,drug2anddrug3. An infected individual could fall in to any
of the intervals described above, and similarly a full-blow n disease diagnosed
individual could fall in the same interval, but for a given in dividual the chrono-
logical time of infection would be earlier than that of diagn osis of the disease.

4.Generalization for multiple drug impact
In this section, expressions for the conditional probabili ties are presented
when multiple drugs are administrated in the population. Re fer to the sec-
tions 2 and 3 for introduction on the role of various drugs and refer to the
section 4 for basic formulations of conditional probabilit ies when there are
three types of drugs to prolong the incubation period and wit hout any drug
situation that would not alter natural process of disease pr ogression. Modeling
for the situation corresponding to no drug is highly relevan t for those countries
where surveillance and diagnosis of infections are not comp lete and several in-
dividuals with HIV are not taking drugs. Let N={N0,N1,N2, ...,N N}be the
number of available drugs and Z={Z0,Z1,Z2,...,ZN}be their corresponding
incubation periods. Further let Z0< Z1< Z2<,...,< Z NandAandBbe
their parametric sets. ThenINCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 19

jis maximized for the set [Ai,Bi]by the procedure ex-
plained in the previous section. We will obtain Nsets of[A,B]values, and
the corresponding likelihood values are LN1,LN2,LN3,...,LNN.In the above,
we have assumed monotonicity of (Zi)to arrive at (4.2). If the (Zi)val-
ues are not monotonic then the various conditional probabil ities can be con-
structed as explained in the previous section. There we expl ained the general
expression when there were a ﬁnite number of drugs available on the market.
A detailed construction of various conditional probabilit ies is not necessary
for the purpose of the present section (for details see Appen dix I). When
theZisare not monotonic, and if they follow some order, say for exam ple,
Z0> Z1< Z2> ... < Z N,then the conditional probabilities can be con-
structed in the same way as equations (3.7e3.9) were. Suppos e(Zp)are equal
for each p, then there will be two scenarios arising: one for before dru g in-
tervention and one after drug intervention. For this situat ion, the likelihood

5.Theoretical examples
In this section, we show some examples of the likelihood func tion constructed
in the previous section, to estimate A,andB.Leth(s)follow a quadratic
exponential and Bfollow a) a gamma function, and b) a logistic function.
Infections in most of the countries started declining after the availability of
antiretroviral therapies [9, 11], and incidence in the rece nt period was found
to be stable in some countries like India [19]. This motivate d us to choose a
quadratic exponential to represent h(s), namely h(s) =exp(α1s2+α2s+α3)for
all−∞< α1,α2,α3<∞. A quadratic exponential function has been shown
to be a good model for representing the above declines in the i ncidence rates
[17]. The incubation period for AIDS is large as well as varia ble, therefore,
functions like the gamma, Weibull and logistic can mimic sev eral shapes to ﬁt
the incubation period data depending on their parameter val ues. Such well-
known functions were used by many researchers for modeling t he incubation
period of AIDS. We now demonstrate the application of such fu nctions for the
theory explained in section 2.

6.Age-structured populations
In this section we extend the models 1.3 and 1.4 to accommodat e age struc-
ture into the population mixing and epidemiology parameter s. The incubation
period for children is shorter than that of adults. Within th e adult popula-
tion there could be variability due to age at the time of infec tion. There are
studies that analyze the HIV data on age collected at the time of infection to
study parameters like incubation period [5], and some studi es incorporate age
structure in the models to explain the impact of an age-depen dent incubation
period [10]. Information on population age structure is imp ortant source of
data in a country with severe AIDS epidemic. Countries with h igh number of
young adults and with high-risk behavior need special inter ventions in terms
of behavioral counseling, treatment of drugs, monitoring a nd evaluation of the
epidemic. For most of the countries with high numbers of HIV i nfected in-
dividuals, age-related data for measuring impact of drugs a re not available.
Virus transmission rates, disease progression rates and mo rtality rates could
be highly age-dependent. Improving surveillance activiti es by age-structure of
the HIV infected and susceptible populations would beneﬁt t he overall disease
control programs in a country. In the absence of availabilit y of cohort data, the
methods explained in section 2 could be of great use to estima te the incubation
period. The analysis and method explained there could be car ried out based
on the data available for individuals of every age (rounded t o closest integer).
We describe the age-structure model and the method to obtain the incubation
period in this section by considering jage groups. In a hospital set-up it is
relatively easy to follow cohorts of age groups compared to f ollowing cohorts
of individuals for each age group.
Suppose the population in the jthage group is divided into Xjsusceptible,
Y0,j,Y1,j,Y2,j,Y3,jare infected and Dz0,j,Dz1,j,Dz2,j,Dz3,jindividuals with
the disease without drugs, and for drug1, drug2, drug3 respectively. The
diﬀerential equations explaining these variables areINCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 28

6.1.Varying incubation periods for age-structured population s.We
are interested in the average incubation period for a group o f individuals in the
age group j. IfH(j)is the time of infection and Z(j)is the incubation period
for thejthage group, then the time of onset of the disease for this age gr oup is
D(j) =H(j)+Z(j).This is the time of onset of the disease for an individual
who acquired the infection while in the jthage group. Development of the
disease will be some time units (for example: months, years) after infection at
agej.An individual who acquired the infection at age jis assumed to develop
the full disease before completion of the same age jor> j. Given H(j),
for some j, thenD(j)is allowed to occur at age j′(j′=j,j+ 1,···,j+ω,
wherej+ωis the last age group for the possibility of infection). Clea rly,
H(j)≤D(j). H(j) =D(j)is possible if an individual acquired infection
and attains disease before completion of age j.One can do analysis using a
bi-annual (or half-yearly) aging process.
Consider an infection and disease development matrix (see ﬁ gure 6.1) where
each cell (j,j′)denotes the (infection age groups, disease onset age groups ) for
j= 0,1,2,...,j+ω;j′= 0,1,2,...,j+ω.Only those cells for which j≤j′are
provided, and other cells are left blank for which the incuba tion period is not
deﬁned. In the matrix, all the eligible cells are denoted, so obviously there areINCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 30

low. (In fact, the average incubation period is not beyond a c ertain duration.
It is not intended in the matrix to suggest that the lower the v alue ofjthen
the larger the value of incubation period). If the age of infe ction is higher, for
somej, and towards the last few possible age groups, then it is poss ible that
j′−jis shorter because individuals die naturally in old age. At t he same time,
the chance of infection in the very higher age groups (say 60+ ) is negligible for
HIV (unless there are some rare causes). In the absence of age speciﬁc cohorts
of infected individuals and follow-up data, it is not feasib le to calculate disease
progression rates and survival probabilities using direct cohort methods. In
this section, we extend the method given in section 2 to estim ate the average
disease progression rates (or average incubation periods) for infections in age
groupj. This method is dependent on infection densities and data on disease
occurrences for the age group j.
Letp(t,j)andq(t,j)be the probability density functions of infection density
and incubation period for the age group j.IfQ(t,j)is the distribution function
of the incubation period, then Q(t,j) =/integraltextt

Suppose an individual is diagnosed with a disease at age jin the year Uk.
Then there is a possibility that this individual acquired th e infection in any
of the years prior to Uk(provided this individual is born in the year ≥U0).
Similarly, all those individuals who are diagnosed with the disease at age j+w
in the year Unhave actually acquired infection in any of the years from U0to
Un.In the same way, an individual infected at age jwill be diagnosed with
the disease in an age group ≥j.We consider model (6.1), where four types of
drugs were considered in section 2.

7.Conclusions
The methods and models developed support further biologica l and epidemi-
ological experiments in the HIV infected population. As per the current WHO
guidelines, ART is prescribed only when CD4 count reaches 25 0. Experiments
indicate mortality rate among HIV infected population drop s after individ-
uals are on ART, and hence expected life years remaining once individuals
reaches CD4 = 250 is diﬀerent for those individuals who are on ART and who
are not on ART. After providing ART for all the eligible peopl e, the length
of life gained by individuals can be measured and resultant f unctional form
can be modeled. Similarly, a model can be built for lengths of lives for those
individuals who reach CD4=250 and not on ART.
The improved models that address the impacts of anti-retrov iral therapy,
protease inhibitors and combination of drugs presented in s ection 1 seem use-
ful in understanding the dynamics of variables for individu als with the full
blown disease for no-drug, drug1, drug2 anddrug3, i.e Dz0,Dz1,Dz2andDz3.
Using the methodology in sections 2 to 4, (despite being leng thy), one can
able to estimate the parameters for the incubation period fo r each drug type,
by the deconvolution method. We have demonstrated this meth od for three
types of drugs, and one can obtain Bfor as many drugs as possible from the
formulas for n−types of drugs in section 3. So far, there is no evidence of
drugs being useful in avoiding contracting the disease. Dru gs may be useful
for avoiding opportunistic infections for some speciﬁc per iods of time. Eventu-
ally, an individual will succumb to AIDS, whether or not that individual takes
drugs (which is also demonstrated in the truncation eﬀect in Figure 9.1). The
truncation eﬀect formulas can be used to obtain the paramete r set (say, BT),
but we did not demonstrate this numerically. There were othe r type of meth-
ods for obtaining incubation periods (see [18] when data is c ensored and see
[48] when data is from hospital based cohort)
We did not introduce intracellular delay that might arise du e drug interven-
tions. There are not many quantitative results available on the relationship
between the dose of a drug and the resultant delay in the devel opment of
the disease. Suppose s1,s2,s3...,skareklevels of doses of a single drug, and
τ1,τ2,τ3,...,τkare the respective delays obtained in producing a new infect ed
cell. Then we can write the relation R2(s,τ)between sandτas

R2(s,τ)is called the correlation coeﬃcient of dose-delay. sis the mean
dose-level and τis the mean delay. This experiment can be conducted for
various doses sij(say) for drug type j= 1,2,3...n. Each drug will produce
a delay depending upon the dose level. From this, the average delay can be
statistically compared to understand the mean dose eﬀect du e to a particular
drug, and hence the drug eﬃcacy. However, this does not give d ynamics over
the time period, but it is very useful in preparing the baseli ne parameters for
simulation studies, and also for the models explained in sec tions 1, 2 and 5.
There might be a possibility of exploring the impact of delay in the conditional
probabilities expressed in this work.
Our work may be interesting for people working on developing computa-
tional techniques for solving integro-diﬀerential equati ons, algorithms to solve
convolution type equations in epidemiology, and EM-type al gorithms. The
age-structure analysis presented is more complicated than analysis presented
for the non-age structured populations, and we provide a new kind of analysis
for the incubation period. When reported disease cases and d ensities of the
infection are available for a period of several years in the p opulation, then
this kind of analysis oﬀers a reliable method to estimate the incubation period
distribution.INCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 40

8.Appendix I : Conditional probabilities for generalized
multiple drug impact
Here we derive expressions for conditional probabilities w hen several drugs
are available, and the incubation period is non-monotonic. When such a sit-
uation arises there will be several combinations of orders o fZs.We take one
such situation and write corresponding Lsfor the purpose of demonstration.
Suppose Z0< ... < Z k=...=Zk+n+1< ... < Z N.Let us divide this into the
following two inequalities and an equality: Z0< ... < Z k,Zk+1=...=Zk+n
andZk+n+1< ... < Z N.If we consider the ﬁrst and third inequalities, then
D(A,B/UNk) =/integraldisplayUN0
0h(t/AN0)G(t−s/BN0)ds+
/integraldisplayUN1
UN0h(t/AN1)G(t−s/BN1)ds

D(A,B/UNN) =/integraldisplayUNn+k+1

/integraldisplayUNn+k+2
UN0h(t/ANn+k+2)G(t−s/BNn+k+2)ds
···+/integraldisplayUNN
UNN−1h(t/ANN)G(t−s/BNN)ds
We can express {P(ENθ/E)}θ=k
θ=0and{P(ENθ/E)}θ=N
θ=n+k+1and the correspond-
ing{LNθ}θas shown in the section 3. Then LNθis maximized for the set
[Aθ,Bθ]. We obtain N−n−ksets of[A,B]values, and the corresponding
likelihood functions {LNθ}k

Figure 9.1. Truncated incubation period. The idea of trun-
cated cumulative distribution of the incubation period is p lot-
ted. After a certain time duration, there will not be any gain
due to therapy. Median incubation period is represented by t he
line cutting the curve at 0.5, corresponding to the Y-axis.
9.Appendix II: Truncated incubation period
Suppose there is an upper bound for the impact of drugs on the i ncubation
period; that is, the incubation period cannot be increased a fter a certain time
point after the drug use. Then the likelihood equations expl ained in section
4 would change accordingly. There was an attempt earlier to t runcate the
incubation period with the help of the truncated Weibull dis tribution [17].
They have not seen the impact of drugs using such functions. I fZ,the length
of the incubation period, and if Zcis the truncation point, then G(Z) =

For each drug type, an expression of the type in (9.1) can be de rived. Despite
the assumption on truncation as mentioned above, the incuba tion period could
vary according to the type of the drug.INCUBATION PERIOD, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPIES, AGE-STRUC TURES 47
