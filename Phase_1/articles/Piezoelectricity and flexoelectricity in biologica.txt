Abstract
Living tissues experience various external forces on cells, influencing their behaviour, physiology, shape,
gene expression, and destiny through interactions with their environment. Despite much research done in
this area, challenges remain in our better understanding of the behaviour of the cell in response to external
stimuli, including the arrangement, quantity, and shape of organelles within the cell. This study explores
the electromechanical behaviour of biological cells, including organelles like microtubules, mitochondria,

elucidated by introducing a new parameter called the maximum electric potential ratio (VR,max ). It has
been found that VR,max depends upon the orientation angle and shape of the microtubules. Further, the
study reveals that the number of microtubules significantly impacts e ffective elastic and piezoelectric

1. Introduction
Cell mechanics plays a vital role in the development, functioning, metabolism, and regulation of nuclear
responses in cells. The primary factors that determine the mechanical properties of the cell are the elasticity
of the cell, adhesion between the cell and its substrate, and membrane tension [1, 2]. The biological cell
exhibits a highly intricate internal structure. The cell comprises two primary constituents: the cytoplasm
and the nucleus. The cytoplasm is a fluidic matrix that commonly surrounds the nucleus and is enclosed by
the cellular plasma membrane [3, 4].

Preprint submitted to ... March 5, 2024arXiv:2403.02050v1  [q-bio.QM]  4 Mar 2024Organelles are subcellular structures that are microscopic and are located within the cytoplasm. These
structures are responsible for carrying out various functions that are essential for maintaining the stability of
the cell’s internal environment, also known as homeostasis [5]. These functions include energy generation,
protein synthesis and release, toxin removal, and the reception of external stimuli. The organelles undergo
alterations by changing their shape, quantity, and spatial arrangement inside the cell, which a ffects their
structure and organization [6–8]. Cellular dynamics are directly impacted by processes such as division,
merging, morphological changes, transportation, and external stimuli [9]. For instance, mitochondria are
attached to the cytoskeleton at precise sites within the cell. Neurons rely on mitochondrial anchoring to
ensure that mitochondria are solidly attached to presynaptic locations in axons, enabling them to provide
the necessary energy for neurotransmission [10–12].
The regulation of microtubule dynamics is crucial for the proper functioning and division of all
eukaryotic cells. The wide range of actions is primarily facilitated by the dynamic ends of microtubules,
which can attach to di fferent targets within the cell, produce mechanical forces, and interact with actin
microfilaments [13]. Microtubules are cellular structures that play an essential part in understanding how
related proteins, mechanical forces, and microtubule-targeting medicines, such as cancer
chemotherapeutics, regulate the mechanisms of microtubule function [14, 15]. Microtubules also play a
crucial role in facilitating the transportation of diverse cellular structures, such as lysosomes,
mitochondria, and other organelles [16, 17]. The structure of microtubules is based on dimers composed of
α- and β-tubulin, which exhibit an elongated, non-branching polymer pattern [18]. Each microtubule
consists of approximately thirteen dimeric tubulin molecules arranged in a circular configuration [19]. The
length of the microtubule can be modified through the addition or removal of dimers. The microtubules,
which have rigid structures found within cells, can cause significant strain fluctuations due to their small
size and interaction with a flexible cellular matrix. Further, they provide sti ffness to the structures, and
their number depends on cell type, structural characteristics, and the primary function [20]. Among the
many cell types that may be found in a wide variety of organisms, ranging from protists to mammals, cilia
and flagella are two structures that are particularly notable and widely recognized. Protists have the ability
to arrange microtubules in various diverse formations, which results in the construction of structures that
are both unique and comprehensive [21]. Some motile cilia contain di fferent numbers of microtubules,
such as singlets in apicomplexans, fungi, and Caenorhabditis elegans [22, 23], symmetrical basal bodies
with nine microtubules, and complex organelles like motile cilium with 9 +2 structures [6–8]. Axonemes in
protozoans, insects, arthropods, and nematodes have varying numbers of microtubule doublets, precisely
10, 12, 14, 16, or 18 [24–28]. External stimuli increase actin stress fibres in cells exposed to shear stress or
geometric patterns, resulting in an increase in the cytoskeletal network [29].
Many computational studies [30–34] have focused on the mechanical coupling between strain and
stress in nanowires and plates. It has been reported that a significant proportion of biological components,
such as microtubules, bones, and collagen, exhibit piezoelectric properties. For instance, during walking,
the human tibia produces a piezoelectric potential of approximately 300 µV [35]. Therefore, it is important
to conduct a thorough investigation into the mechanics of the cell and its organelles in order to gain a better
understanding of their piezoelectric properties. The discovery of piezoelectricity has a long history,
starting with the Curie brothers, who, in 1880, observed that some crystals display both positive and
negative charges under pressure, which disappear once the pressure is released. This resulted in their
discovery of piezoelectricity. Later, scientists used the term “piezoelectricity” to describe the direct
relationship between mechanical stress and electricity [36–42]. Since then, piezoelectricity,understood as
the direct relationship between electrical and mechanical energy, is widely used in various applications,
including artificial muscles, wearable sensors, advanced microscopes, flexible actuators, energy harvesting
2devices, and minimally invasive surgery [40, 43–49]. On the other hand, flexoelectricity is a bidirectional
linear interaction between the electric field and strain gradients, unlike piezoelectricity, which occurs due
to electric polarization and strain. It is characterized by strain gradients or inhomogeneous strains, while
uniform strains cause piezoelectricity [47, 48, 50]. While non-centrosymmetric materials in physical and
biological systems exhibit linear piezoelectricity, which is the coupling of a single strain component with a
single electric field component [46, 49], flexoelectricity can occur even in materials with centrosymmetry,
especially when inhomogeneities at micro length scales lead to significant strain gradients and electric field
formation [51, 52]. Despite their minimal e ffects, often at larger scales, flexoelectric contributions to
electromechanical coupling are likely to be substantial at smaller scales [33, 53].
Given these coupled e ffects, it becomes apparent that further research is necessary to fully understand
how living cells behave, especially in the context of their variable organelle shapes. The structure and
orientation of the organelles are essential for comprehending the dynamics of the cell. Moreover, the
quantity of microtubules within a cell plays a crucial role in cell dynamics. These aspects have not yet
been thoroughly investigated [27, 28]. Recent experimental studies [54, 55] show that microtubules are
mostly composed of α- andβ-tubulin dimerization, resulting in a polarized tubular structure. Cells can
extend and contract at the plus end. Cell morphology may depend on microtubule reorientation.
Non-centrosomal microtubules (NC-MTs) may a ffect cell adhesion and division, depending on cell type.
However, these implications have not been explored in the context of piezoelectric and flexoelectric
effects. Despite notable progress, there is still a considerable dearth of understanding the functioning of
individual organelles and their integrated behaviour within the living cells when they are exposed to
external stimuli such as piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity [33, 45–49]. The significance of mechanical
stimuli in regulating cell functions is becoming even more apparent, given the fact that the understanding
of the immediate structural reaction of cells to mechanical stresses is still inadequate [29].
Therefore, the primary aim of this work is to investigate the impact of externally exerted mechanical
displacement on the characteristics of individual cells, with a specific emphasis on the variable shapes and
sizes of organelles. In what follows, we carry out an extensive parametric analysis to examine the e ffects
of piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity by varying the number of microtubules from 2 to 18 along with their
shapes when the cells are subjected to the mechanical displacements. The mechanical response of the cell is
elucidated by determining the e ffective elastic coe fficients, and the contribution of piezoelectricity resulting
from mechanical displacement is quantified through the e ffective piezoelectric coe fficients.
The rest of the paper has been structured as follows: Section 2 describes the model that governs the
coupled electro-elastic behaviour of the cells, including the geometry of the cell structure and the boundary
conditions. The results obtained from the present study, which include the e ffects of piezoelectricity and
flexoelectricity on the distribution of electric potential, strain, e ffective elastic coe fficients, and e ffective
piezoelectric coe fficients, are delineated in Section 3. The findings are summarized in Section 4.
2. Physics-based model of the biological cell
This section details the developed model of the biological cell, including material properties, mathematical
framework, numerical setup, and boundary conditions necessary for problem solving. The cell has a width
ofaw=21µm [56–58]. It contains distinct organelles with well-defined shapes in cell structure-1 in the
x1−x3plane. However, the realistic organelles lack a specific and well-defined shape. Therefore, we have
also selected arbitrary shapes for intracellular organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, cytoplasm,
microtubules, cell membrane, and centrosome, for cell structure-2. The arbitrary shapes of the organelles
have been created using an in-house developed MATLAB code. The organelles possess unique structures
that exhibit a diverse range of sizes and shapes within cellular compartments. For instance, mitochondria

are portrayed as rigid, long, cylinder-shaped structures that resemble bacteria. They are highly elastic and
dynamic organelles that are always undergoing shape changes [9, 59, 60]. The morphology of the nucleus
[61–65], cell membrane [62, 66, 67], and mitochondria [66, 68–70] exhibits distinct characteristics in the
cell structures, as shown in Figure 1. The shape of the cell model has been created based on the experimental
studies [57, 60, 71–73] as depicted in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). Similarly, the shapes of organelles such as
the nucleus [61–65], cell membrane [62, 66, 67], and mitochondria [66, 68–70], are modelled based on
experimental and other computational studies. The dimensions of the organelles have been taken as follows
[74]: nucleus, 5 µm [56]; mitochondria, 0.92 µm [56]; microtubule, 25 nm (diameter), length 5-15 µm
[60, 73, 75]; cell membrane, 20 µm (diameter), 7 µm [56, 57].
Both cell structures are presumed to possess an equivalent quantity of organelles, comprising 12
mitochondria, 18 microtubules, 1 nucleus, 1 cytosol, and 1 cell membrane, for the purpose of conducting a
comparison analysis. Furthermore, it has been considered that all intercellular organelles have identical
surface areas compared to their counterparts in the cell structures. The lengths of the microtubules are
varied, and their inward ends have been connected to the centrosome. The cell membrane has been
conceptualized as a structural barrier that delineates the intracellular compartment of the cell from the
extracellular matrix environment [14].
The material properties pertaining to the organelles that have been utilized in the current study are
outlined in Table 1. This study focuses on the piezoelectric and flexoelectric coe fficients that relate to
microtubules, while neglecting the consideration of these coe fficients for other organelles; they are assumed
to be zero [58].
The fully coupled electromechanical model, based on the extended linear theory of continuum
mechanics for dielectric continua, has been used to analyze the two-dimensional biological cell domain in
a steady-state regime. Under equilibrium conditions and based on Gauss’s law, the governing equations for
the current two-dimensional computational domain are given as:

By employing the two-dimensional biological cell model described above and assuming the presence
of transversely isotropic piezoelectric material along the x3-axis, the electromechanical phenomena can be
investigated using either the x1-x3orx2-x3planes. Therefore, when considering the x1-x3plane, using the
V oigt notation, the constitutive relations (Eqs. 4-6) can be reduced into matrix form, as follows [58, 84–86]:

Collagen and microtubule-associated tau proteins exhibit comparable crystalline homology [87]. As a
result, the generation of piezoelectric potential is comparable in both proteins when subjected to similar
load conditions [88]. Therefore, in the present study, it has been assumed that the piezoelectric coe fficients
of the microtubules are equivalent to those of collagen. The hexagonal symmetry has been taken into
consideration in order to determine each piezoelectric coe fficient for collagen. The piezoelectric tensor can

Given that the current study is based on the stress form, the piezoelectric coe fficients provided in Eq. 11
in strain form have been transformed into the stress form using the following relationship:
ei jk=cjklmdilm, (12)
where ei jkare the piezoelectric stress coe fficients, cjklmare the components of the elastic tensor, and dilm
are the piezoelectric strain coe fficients.
The orientation of the microtubules and their e ffect on the piezoelectric tensor have also been taken into
account in this work. The transformation of the piezoelectric coe fficients has been formulated elsewhere
[58].
2.1. Boundary conditions
The details of the biological cell geometry and the governing equations to understand the piezoelectric
behaviour of the biological cell are provided previously. Here, we discuss the impact of mechanical
displacements on the biological cell, specifically examining three di fferent boundary conditions to
understand the cell response comprehensively, as shown in Table 2. The bottom surface of the
two-dimensional biological cell model depicted in Figure 2 has been subjected to fixed boundary
conditions that are electrically grounded ( V=0). These restrictions have been adopted from previous
studies [90–93] and inspired by experimental investigations [6–8, 20, 22–26, 94]. The direction in which
the mechanical displacement is exerted on the piezoelectric material is as follows:
•Boundary condition-1 (BC-1): A mechanical displacement is exerted at the top of the boundary by

Figure 2: A finite element model of a single cell is created with specific boundary conditions (BC). Compressive displacement
(DC) in terms of u1andu3is applied to the cell, ranging from 20 to 120nm, in three di fferent configurations: (a) on the top of
the cell, (b) on the left and right sides of the cell, and (c) on the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the cell, while the bottom is
electrically grounded in all the cases, i.e., the electric potential ( V) is set to zero.
•Boundary condition 2 (BC-2) involves the application of a mechanical displacement at the left, right,
and top boundaries by altering the compressive displacement within the range of 20 nm to 120 nm,
as depicted in Figure 2(b).
•Boundary condition-3 (BC-3) deals with the imposition of a mechanical displacement at the left,
8right, top, and bottom boundaries of the system. This force is exerted by altering the compressive
displacement values within the range of 20 nm to 120 nm, as depicted in Figure 2(c).
These boundary conditions are very important to understand the cell mechanics in many applications,
including bone repair [94–98].
To investigate the mechanical response and piezoelectric behavior of the biological cell more precisely,
effective coe fficients have been determined by creating many load instances with varying boundary
conditions. Each load instance should be structured in such a way that only one value in the strain /electric
field vector is non-zero, with all other values being zero. To determine the e ffective coe fficient, use an
average non-zero value in the strain /electric field vector and the average values in the stress /electrical
displacement vector [99–102]. The e ffective elastic coe fficients and e ffective piezoelectric coe fficients are
computed in the principal plane directions ( x1-x3) under the specified boundary conditions, i.e., the
mechanical ( c11,e f f,c13,e f f, and c33,e f f) and piezoelectric response ( e31,e f f, and e33,e f f) of the biological
cell in the transverse and longitudinal directions [84, 86]. The volume average of quantity Ais denoted by

where Ωrepresents the volume of the domain in which the integration is performed. Adenotes the area of

The e ffective elastic and piezoelectric coe fficients are calculated by utilizing the volume averages for
the boundary conditions specified in Section 2.1, which are as follows [84]:

where⟨D3⟩is the volume average of the D3component of the electric flux density vector.
The finite element analysis has been performed to numerically implement the coupled electromechanical
model described above using COMSOL multiphysics while applying boundary conditions to the biological
cell.
3. Results and discussion
Cell mechanics refers to the division and merging of cell organelles, which are crucial for maintaining their
structure, distribution, and size. In order to investigate the cell behaviour when it is subjected to mechanical
displacement, three boundary conditions (BC-1 to BC-3) are employed for the compressive displacement
ranging from 20 nm to 120 nm. The current study presents a comparative analysis of the piezoelectric e ffect
in the cell, and analyzing the outcomes both with and without consideration of flexoelectric e ffects for the
strain distribution, electric potential distribution, and determination of the e ffective elastic and piezoelectric
coefficients.
3.1. Impact of piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects on strain distribution in biological cells
The strain component ( ε11) distribution in the x1-direction inside the biological cell as a result of the
combined e ffects of piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity is shown in Figure 3. The distribution has been
9derived for two distinct cell structures subjected to a compressive displacement of 20 nm, while accounting
for three applied boundary conditions (BC-1 to BC-3). For BC-1, the magnitude of ε11is concentrated in
close proximity to the cell membrane, as well as the top and bottom walls of the cell, as depicted in
Figure 3(a)-(b). This distribution of strain is a result of the application of compressive mechanical
displacement in the transverse direction. For BC-2 and BC-3, the magnitude of ε11is concentrated toward
the corners of the bottom walls of the cell.
On the other hand, there is a noticeable di fference in the distribution of the strain component ( ε33) in
thex3-direction compared to the x1-direction within the biological cell. This di fference is attributed to the
combined influence of piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity, as depicted in Figure 4.
The impact of flexoelectric stress components on the strain distribution is insignificant. Therefore,
the strain distribution for the e ffect of piezoelectricity only and for the combined e ffect of piezoelectricity
and flexoelectricity show a remarkable similarity and have nearly comparable magnitudes, as depicted in
Figures 3 to 4. Nevertheless, the strain distribution in the x3-direction is slightly greater than in the x1-
direction, as the flexoelectric stress component in the x3-direction is 1.80 times larger than its component in
thex1-direction, regardless of the boundary conditions (BC-1 to BC-3). The flexoelectric stress component
in cell structure-2 has exhibited a notable alteration in comparison to CS-1 as a result of the modifications
in the shape, size, and orientation of the microorganelles, particularly the microtubules.
3.2. Electrical potential distribution
The electric potential distribution of a biological cell under compressive displacement has been determined
by solving the governing equations described in Section 2. Accordingly, the electric potential
distribution for each boundary condition applied to the cell considering only the piezoelectric e ffect and
the combined piezoelectric-flexoelectric e ffects is provided below.
3.2.1. Consideration of piezoelectric e ffects alone
The electric potential (V) distribution within the biological cell, resulting from a 20 nm mechanical
(compressive) displacement, accounting for the piezoelectric e ffect alone, is illustrated in Figure 5. The
distribution is studied under three applied boundary conditions, marked as BC-1 to BC-3. The arrows
indicate the direction of the electric field lines within the cell. In all the cases, BC-1 and BC-3, it is evident
from Figure 5(a)-(d) that the electric potential generated is higher for CS-1 in comparison to CS-2. The
strain distribution is no more streamlined along the boundary of the microtubules due to the localization of
the strain near to the curved edges. As a result, the intensity of the strain distribution in the vicinity of the
centrosome is reduced. Hence, the overall electric potential being generated in the cell is reduced.
Consequently, a weak piezoelectric e ffect leads to the generation of a lower electric potential. The electric
potential being generated has been reduced by a factor of 10 when BC-3 is applied to the biological cell
compared to BC-1 and BC-2 (see Figure 5(e)-(f)).
3.2.2. Consideration of flexoelectric e ffects in addition to piezoelectric e ffects
There is a significant enhancement of the electric potential distribution within the cell when considering
the application of non-local flexoelectric e ffects in addition to the linear piezoelectric e ffects. Figures 6(a),
6(c) and 6(e) depict the electric potential distribution in CS-1, whereas Figures 6(b), 6(d) and 6(f) for the
CS-2. The contour plots displayed in Figures 6(a)-(d) demonstrate that, under all three boundary conditions
(BC-1 to BC-3), the electric potential generated in CS-1 is greater than that of CS-2. The strain gradients
are stronger for the regular shapes of organelles in the cell (CS-1). The electric potential generated in BC-2
is observed to increase due to the absence of strain gradients in the longitudinal directions. The transverse
direction ( x3) exhibits a strain gradient that is responsible for the increased electric potential compared

potential when considering only the piezoelectric e ffect.
3.2.3. Consideration of the number of microtubules and the shape of the organelles
It is observed that the maximum electrical potential obtained for each boundary condition and cell
structure is also di fferent, as depicted in Figures 5 and 6. This is attributed to the shape and arrangement of
the microtubules within the biological cell that have a significant impact on the distribution of the electric
potential [89]. The absence of longitudinal and transverse strains in BC-3 can be attributed to the uniform
displacement boundary conditions in the principal planes, i.e., x1and x3. Nevertheless, only a small
amount of transverse strain is generated near the corners of the bottom side due to the applied mechanical
displacement. This can be attributed to the negligible piezoelectric e ffect, resulting in a low generation of
electric potential in this case.
The growth, maintenance, and regulation of cells and tissues depend on the strength of electric fields.
Moreover, studying electric potential distribution within the cell is essential for tissue regeneration,
embryonic development, and wound healing [103, 104]. For instance, electric fields are used in tissue
engineering for characterizing artificial tissues, forming tissue-like materials, and micro-manipulating
cells. Electrical stimulation has emerged as a novel and cutting-edge method in the field of regenerative
medicine [105, 106].
3.2.4. Maximum induced electric potential considering the piezoelectric e ffect and the combined
piezoelectric-flexoelectric e ffects
A parametric analysis has been carried out to quantify the maximum electric potential ( Vmax) obtained when
a compressive displacement of 20 nm is applied for BC-1 to BC-3. The number of microtubules in the
present two-dimensional biological cell considered are 18, as shown in Figure 7. When considering purely
the piezoelectric e ffect, CS-1 generates a Vmaxlarger than CS-2 for BC-1, as illustrated in Figure 7(a). On
the other hand, Vmaxshows a significant rise in the case of CS-1 when both the piezoelectric and flexoelectric
effects are taken into account together for BC-1, as shown in Figure 7(b) and a similar pattern is observed
for BC-2 and BC-3. An increase in the number of microtubules in the cellular structure results in an increase
ofVmax. This increase is evident from the compressive displacement range of 20 nm to 120 nm observed
in BC-1 to BC-3, as shown in Figure 7(a)-(f). This occurs due to the orientation, shape, and number of
microtubules. Recall that, in the present study, the flexoelectric coe fficients are considered only for the
microtubules.
Figure 8 illustrates the variation in Vmaxdistribution resulting from the piezoelectric-flexoelectric
effects within the biological cell, while maintaining boundary conditions and cell structures. This variation
is observed as a function of the compressive displacement and the number of microtubules. In CS-1 for
BC-1, the induced Vmaxis significantly higher for the piezoelectric-flexoelectric e ffects compared to the
piezoelectric e ffect alone. It can be observed from Figure 8(a)-(f) that an increase in the number of
microtubules leads to an increase in the generated Vmaxfor all the boundary conditions. This is attributed
due to the orientation of the microtubules in the cells. Experimentally, it has been found that the orientation
and alignment of microtubules significantly impact the shape and functionality of keratinocyte cells [55].
Figures 7 and 8 also clearly demonstrate that the magnitude of Vmaxfollows a trend of increasing from
BC-1 to BC-2 and thereafter decreasing at BC-3. For instance, when the piezoelectricity alone is considered,
Vmaxfor CS-1 is found to be 1 .18×10−6V (BC-1), 1 .74×10−6V (BC-2), and 4 .92×10−7V (BC-3).
Experimental findings confirm that the maximum induced electric potential in the bone by the piezoelectric
effect is on the order of microvolts ( µV) [94]. Further, a similar pattern has been noticed in the case of CS-2.
This occurs because, in BC-1, the electric potential is solely generated by the transverse strain from the top

17side, without any contribution from the longitudinal strain. In BC-2, the applied compressive displacement
on both the left and right sides is balanced due to the absence of a strain gradient. The gradient of BC-3 is
symmetrical from all directions, resulting in a minimal net value of the electric potential.
Flexoelectricity exerts a substantial influence on the biological cell. It is additionally characterized
by the ratio of the maximum electric potential resulting from the combined e ffects of piezoelectricity and
flexoelectricity to the electric potential arising from piezoelectricity alone ( VR,max =Vmax,P +F/Vmax,P ). This
ratio has been examined in connection with the total number of microtubules under the three specified
boundary conditions, as illustrated in Figure 9. It is evident that the highest value of VR,max occurs when
there are 6 microtubules in the case of CS-2, under the three boundary conditions BC-1 to BC-3. It has been
found that when BC-1 is applied, VR,max for CS-1 takes precedence over CS-2. Whereas VR,max has shown
an uneven trend for CS-1 on imposing BC-2 and BC-3. The primary factor influencing the behaviour is the
angular orientation and shape of the microtubules [94, 107].
This knowledge is very useful to our better understanding of the induced electric potential resulting from
piezoelectricity in the healing mechanism for bone fractures and other medical therapies. For example,
the primary building blocks of bone, collagen and hydroxyapatite, are oriented strongly in the direction
of the bone axis. The direction in which ultrasonic radiation or a load is applied greatly influences the
induced electric potential in the bone resulting from piezoelectricity. The piezoelectric properties of bone
have a role in the healing process of the Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy [37, 94, 108].
The two-dimensional biological cell is significantly influenced by the quantity and loading conditions of
microtubules. The current study predicts a significant increase in electromechanical e ffects, potentially
useful in bio-compatible nano-biosensors, drug delivery, noninvasive diagnostic methods, and treatment
strategies [50, 109–111].
The stimulation of cells depends on the generation of electric potential resulting from the mechanical
load being applied. For instance, the glial cells undergo changes in structure when stimulated electrically
and align themselves perpendicular or parallel to the electric field [112]. Hence, cell stimulation depends
on the intensity of the electric potential, which is dependent on the boundary condition. The biological
cell having a structure with regular-shaped organelles exhibited over cellular stimulation than the arbitrary
shapes of the organelles. The previous study utilized a cell structure [58] model that exhibited regular shapes
of the organelles. Therefore, in the present study, we carry out a more realistic analysis where the shapes
of the organelles have been chosen to be arbitrary, which are non-spherical in nature. Moreover, the cell
stimulation is controlled by varying the mechanical displacement as described previously (Section 2.1).
3.3. Determination of the e ffective elastic coe fficients
Effective elastic coe fficients are computed using Eqs. 13 and 14 to elucidate the mechanical response of
the cell, which show that the principal plane stresses are the only factors influencing these coe fficients.
The compressive displacement has an impact on the e ffective elastic coe fficients, c11,e f fandc33,e f fin
the principal planes ( x1andx3). We also have another elastic coe fficient, c13,e f f, defined as the ratio of
the average principal stress in the x3-direction to the principal strain in the x1-direction. The following
sub-section discusses the numerical studies conducted to investigate the variations in the e ffective elastic
coefficients influenced by biological cells’ local geometry and physical properties, considering only the
piezoelectric and combined piezoelectric-flexoelectric e ffects.
3.3.1. Consideration of piezoelectric e ffects alone and combination of piezoelectric-flexoelectric e ffects
BC-1 clearly demonstrates that the mechanical response of the cell in the x1-direction, c11,e f f, is 100
times greater for CS-1 than for CS-2, considering solely the piezoelectric e ffect, as shown in Figure 10(a).
Because the compressive displacement is given to the upper side of the cell. This shows that the predicted

value of c11,e f fdepends not only on the elastic coe fficients but also on the geometry of the cell [113].
Additionally, it should be noted that the value of c11,e f fremains constant for both the piezoelectric and
flexoelectric e ffects.
For BC-2, there is no fluctuation in the value of c11,e f ffor CS-2 when only the piezoelectric e ffect has
been taken into account. However, the value of c11,e f fis lower for CS-1 compared to CS-2 and displays
variation for CS-1, as depicted in Figure 10(b). The compressive displacement is exerted on three sides of
the cell, while the bottom side is electrically grounded. Therefore, there is no variation in stress along the
x3-direction, and it is only present in the x1-direction. c11,e f fexhibits a declining trend in the context of
19the combined piezoelectric and flexoelectric phenomena as the number of microtubules is augmented from
2 to 6. However, it experiences a rapid surge at 10 microtubules, followed by a subsequent decrease (see
Figure 10(b)).
Upon analyzing Figure 10(c), it becomes apparent that when the compressive displacement is applied
to all sides of the cell (BC-3), the e ffective coe fficient of c11,e f fdisplays lower values for CS-1 initially,
but eventually reaches the same value as CS-2 when just the piezoelectric e ffect is taken into account. The
effective elastic constant c11,e f fis larger for CS-1 compared to CS-2, particularly for up to 4 microtubules,
considering the combination of the piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects, and c11,e f fshows a declining
pattern in CS-1. This drop is noticed when the number of microtubules is increased from 4 to 6. Moreover,
the effective coe fficient of c11,e f fconverges to a comparable value as that of CS-2 when the number of
microtubules surpasses 10. This is because the stress that is being generated is seen only in the x1-direction
due to the impact of the mechanical displacement.
Figure 11 depicts the changes in c13,e f facross the biological cell, as computed by taking into account
the piezoelectric e ffects. For BC-1, it is apparent from Figure 11(a) that c13,e f fexhibits a consistent pattern
for both CS-1 and CS-2 when only the piezoelectric e ffect is considered. However, it is evident from
Figure 11(b) that c13,e f fvalue remains unchanged for both the piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects. c13,e f f
is shown to decrease initially as the number of microtubules is increased from 2 to 6. This is because the
average stress values in the x3-direction and strain in the x1-direction are the same for both cell structures.
In the case of BC-2, c13,e f fis higher for CS-2 in comparison to CS-1 because the principal stresses and
strains for these cell structures are di fferent. Moreover, the value of c13,e f fremains unchanged for both
the piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects, as depicted in Figure 11(b). It can be observed that the value
ofc13,e f fshows no variation while the number of microtubules is increased from 2 to 6. However, there
is a dramatic decrease in c13,e f fthereafter, followed by a period of no apparent variation. In the case of
BC-3, c13,e f fvalue is lower for CS-2 in comparison to CS-1, specifically for up to 10 microtubules, when
considering the piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects. Subsequently, the value of c13,e f ftends to converge
with that of CS-1 when considering 10 microtubules and beyond, as depicted in Figure 11(c).
Figure 12(a) shows that the e ffective value of c33(the mechanical response of the biological cell in
x3-direction) is greater for CS-1 than for CS-2 in BC-1. Both cell structures exhibit an increasing trend in
c33,e f fwith an increase in the number of microtubules. c33,e f fvalue remains unchanged for both the
piezoelectric and flexoelectric phenomena. The value of c33,e f fexhibits an upward trend when the number
of microtubules increases from 2 to 4. However, it experiences an abrupt decline when the number of
microtubules reaches 6. The values of c33,e f fare shown to increase for both the piezoelectric and
flexoelectric e ffects, as well as for CS-1 and CS-2, extending beyond microtubules 6. The stress and strain
are present only in the x1and x3-directions. As seen in Figure 12(b), both cell structures exhibit a
consistent pattern with an increase in microtubule number for BC-2 when considering the piezoelectric
effect alone, and c33,e f fis slightly larger for CS-1 than CS-2. It is apparent that c33,e f fvalue remains
unchanged for both the piezoelectric and flexoelectric phenomena. c33,e f fis declining as the number of
microtubules increases from 2 to 6. However, it experiences a dramatic decline at 10 microtubules. The
values of c33,e f fare observed to increase for both the piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects considering the
cell structures, CS-1 and CS-2, extending the microtubules beyond 10. In the case of BC-3, it is evident
thatc33,e f fis comparatively lower for CS-1 than for CS-1, specifically within the range of 6 microtubules,
with regard to the piezoelectric and flexoelectric phenomena. The value of c33,e f fis shown to converge
with that of CS-1 when considering 6 microtubules, as depicted in Figure 12(c). In addition, when the
number of microtubules are 10, it is seen that the e ffective value of c33,e f ffor CS-1 starts rapidly
increasing.

3.3.2. Impact of the orientation and shape of the organelles on the e ffective elastic coe fficients
The e ffective elastic coe fficients are significantly influenced by the shape and orientation of the organelles.
When a compressive displacement is given to the top side of the cell, the e ffective value of c11,e f fis higher
for CS-1 compared to CS-2, as depicted in Figure 10(a). Alterations in the cell’s shape and orientation of
the organelles resulted in di fferent e ffective coe fficients of the cell structures, particularly the microtubules
[114]. This phenomenon is also observed when there is an increase in the quantity of microtubules, as it
leads to a shift in their orientation.

c13,e f fexhibits an initial decrease as the number of microtubules is raised from 2 to 6, as depicted
in Figure 11(a). Nevertheless, the orientation of microtubules leads to a significant rise in the e ffective
coefficient, c13,e f f, when the number of microtubules reaches 10. c33shows a positive correlation with
the number of microtubules, increasing as the number of microtubules rises from 2 to 4, as depicted in
Figure 12(a). Nevertheless, it undergoes a sudden decrease once the quantity of microtubules approaches 6.
It is demonstrated that the values of c33,e f frise for CS-1 and CS-2, going beyond the number of microtubules

Figure 12: The e ffective elastic coe fficient ( c33,e f f) of cell structure-1 (CS-1) and cell structure-2 (CS-2) as a function of the number
of microtubules considering only the piezoelectric e ffect (P) and for combined piezoelectric-flexoelectric (P +F) effects are plotted
against the compressive displacement at 20 nm for (a) BC-1, (b) BC-2, and (c) BC-3.
When applying compressive displacement to all sides of the cell except the bottom, c11,e f fshows a
declining trend as the number of microtubules increases from 2 to 6 for CS-1, as depicted in Figure 10(b).
Nevertheless, it experiences a sharp surge at 10 microtubules, followed by a subsequent decrease. However,
unlike CS-1, CS-2 is displaying a distinct pattern. c13,e f fis greater for CS-1 when compared to CS-2,
as illustrated by Figure 11(b). The value of c13,e f fremains unchanged as the number of microtubules
increases from 2 to 6. However, there is a dramatic decrease in c13,e f fthereafter, followed by a period of
no apparent variation. When subjecting the cell to compressive displacement on all sides, it is evident from
23Figure 12(b) that c33increases as the number of microtubules grows for CS-2. However, the e ffective c33
coefficient exhibits minimal fluctuation for CS-1.
When the cell is subjected to compressive displacement on all sides (BC-3), it is clear that c11,e f fis
greater for CS-2 compared to CS-1, particularly for up to 4 microtubules, as shown in Figure 10(c). The
effective value of c11,e f fshows a declining pattern in CS-2. This drop is noticed when the number of
microtubules is increased from 4 to 6. Moreover, the e ffective value of c11,e f fconverges to a comparable
value to that of CS-1 when the number of microtubules surpasses 10. c13,e f fvalue is lower for CS-2
compared to CS-1, particularly for microtubule numbers up to 10, as seen in Figure 11(c). Afterwards, the
value of c13,e f fapproaches convergence with that of CS-1 when considering the number of microtubules
beyond 10. c33,e f fvalue for CS-2 is lower than that of CS-1, particularly for 6 microtubules, as shown in
Figure 12(c). However, it approaches the value of CS-1 when considering 6 microtubules. Furthermore,
as the number of microtubules reaches 10, there is a noticeable and quick increase in the e ffective value of
c33,e f ffor CS-1.
Calculating e ffective elastic coe fficients helps understand biological cell mechanical behavior. For
instance, cell organelles have a non-uniform distribution, with osteoblasts having cellular elasticity in the
cytoplasmic skirt [115–117].
3.4. Determination of the e ffective piezoelectric coe fficients
The presence of piezoelectric inclusions, such as the number of microtubules, significantly impacts the
effective elastic moduli of cell structures. The e ffective piezoelectric coe fficients are calculated by dividing
the average values of the strain component and the electric flux density vector component, i.e., e31,e f f=
⟨D3⟩
ε11,e33,e f f=⟨D3⟩
ε33.
3.4.1. Consideration of only the piezoelectric e ffect and the combination of piezoelectric-flexoelectric
effects
Figure 13 displays the e ffective piezoelectric coe fficient ( e31,e f f) within the cell for piezoelectrici e ffect
alone and the combination of piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects, i.e., applying mechanical strain in the
x3-direction causes a piezoelectric reaction, specifically the production of e31,e f fin the x1-direction [37].
For BC-1, it can be observed that e31,e f fdisplays similar trends for both cell structures (CS-1 and
CS-2), encompassing both the piezoelectric and flexoelectric phenomena, as depicted in Figure 13(a).
Therefore, the impact of flexoelectricity is insignificant. This phenomenon is caused by the alignment of
the microtubules in response to mechanical tension exerted on the top portion of the cell. When it comes to
BC-2, the e ffective value of e31,e f fis higher for CS-2 when compared to CS-1, as depicted in Figure 13(b).
The negative values of e31,e f fin CS-1 are a result of the compressive stresses in x1and x3
directions caused by the mechanical stress on three sides of the cell when the bottom side is electrically
grounded. Therefore, e31,e f fis yielding negative values for CS-1. For BC-3, when comparing CS-2 to
CS-1, the value of e31,e f fshows a trend toward decline with respect to up to four microtubules. This
observation relates to the occurrence of piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity. Afterwards, the value of
e31,e f fshows an increasing pattern and approaches the value of CS-1, as shown in Figure 13(c).
The e ffective coe fficient e33,e f fis calculated for the applied mechanical strain that induces piezoelectric
effect in the x3-direction, as shown in Figure 14. It can be observed from Figures 14(a)-(b) that e33,e f fis
higher for CS-2 than CS-1. This observation holds true for both the piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects in
BC-1 and BC-2. Both CS-1 and CS-2 exhibit similar trends for the values of e33,e f f. In BC-3, the value of
e33,e f fremains constant for both the piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects until the number of microtubules
reaches 10, as depicted in Figure 14(c), after which it exhibits a significant decrease.

3.4.2. Influence of the organelle’s shapes and orientations on the e ffective piezoelectric coe fficients
The e ffective piezoelectric coe fficient, e31,e f f, has been analyzed under three di fferent applied boundary
conditions (BC-1 to BC-3) as a function of the number of microtubules. Despite the symmetry in the shape
of the microtubules, the cell structures exhibit di fferent values of e31,e f fdue to the curved edges at the
surfaces.
In the case of BC-1, e31,e f finitially decreases as the number of microtubules increases from 2 to 6,
as shown in Figure 13(a). However, it subsequently undergoes a significant increase when the number of

microtubules reaches 10. This phenomenon is caused by the alignment of the microtubules in response
to mechanical displacement exerted on the top portion of the cell. From the analysis of Figure 14(a), it is
evident that there is an increase in e33,e f ffor both CS-1 and CS-2 as the number of microtubules is increased
from 2 to 6. e33,e f fdecreases when it transitions from microtubules 6 to 10. Both CS-1 and CS-2 display
comparable patterns in terms of the quantity of microtubules for the values of e33,e f f.
When it comes to BC-2, the value of e31,e f fshows no variation regardless of the number of microtubules
in cell structure-2, as depicted in Figure 13(b). Figure 14b indicates that there is a rise in e33,e f ffor both
26CS-1 and CS-2 when the number of microtubules is raised from 2 to 6 for BC-2. The value of e31,e f fshows
an increasing pattern and approaches the value of CS-1 when the number of microtubules exceeds 10, as
shown in Figure 13(c). This behaviour has been caused by the orientation of the microtubules. Moreover,
the stress is exerted uniformly on all sides of the cell, leading to no strain gradient. e33,e f fconsistent for the
number of microtubules increases from 2 to 10; beyond that, it experiences a notable reduction, as shown
in Figure 14(c).
In summary, a linearly coupled electromechanical model has been developed to quantify cellular
mechanics under external mechanical displacement, considering piezoelectric and nonlocal flexoelectric
effects. The present model assumes that living cells are linear elastic, which provides the first step in the
analysis [91, 118]. Living cells are visco-elastic, and incorporating dynamic analysis addinto a
three-dimensional study could provide more realistic responses with variable shapes of the organelles and
cell structures [119]. Future extensions could also include cellular tensegrity models, which account for
individual components of the cytoskeleton using discrete beam or truss elements [120, 121]. Clearly, in
realistic scenarios, the electro-elastic properties of biological cells are not uniform and exhibit di fferent
qualities in all directions. To capture the intricacies of these phenomena, more sophisticated multiscale
modelling methodologies would need to be developed [104, 122]. Despite limitations, the developed
coupled electromechanical model is an important initial model that incorporates piezoelectric and
flexoelectric e ffects within the biological cell. Comparative analysis of the predicted outcomes could help
understand the complex electromechanical response of biological cells and assist in the design of
electromechanical devices for various medical applications.
4. Conclusions
The presented study has explored a two-dimensional conceptual framework of the biological cell for two
different structures, encompassing many essential organelles that experience distinct mechanical loading
conditions originating from the external environment. The impact of incorporating flexoelectric coupling
into the electromechanical model is significantly more prominent than that of solely introducing
piezoelectric coupling. The cell structures used in the present study are classified into two categories:
regular and arbitrary shapes. Understanding cell mechanics is highly dependent on these structures and the
boundary conditions since they play a significant role in influencing cell behaviour and associated
stimulation. A parametric analysis revealed that cell structures with regular shapes of the organelles
generate a higher maximum electric potential when combined with piezoelectric and flexoelectric e ffects;
this indicates that there are more microtubules in the cellular structure. The mechanical and piezoelectric
responses of the cell under three distinct boundary conditions have been elucidated with the help of the
effective elastic and piezoelectric coe fficients. Cell structures show that the presence of piezoelectric
inclusions, specifically microtubules, significantly a ffects e ffective elastic moduli, leading to increased
effective moduli. The number of microtubules significantly influences the e ffective elastic coe fficients and
piezoelectric coe fficients, both with and without considering the piezoelectric properties, due to the
dependence of the behaviour of cells on their structure, the orientation of the microtubules, and the
direction of mechanical stress. Microtubule number, orientation, and loading conditions significantly
impact cell mechanics, predicting increased electromechanical e ffects. These findings have practical
applications in the development of biocompatible nano-biosensors, drug delivery systems, noninvasive
diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic approaches where the properties of biological cells need to be better
understood.

Appendix A. Mesh Independence analysis
The precision of numerical solutions is contingent upon the specific mesh employed to discretize the
governing equations and boundary conditions. As the mesh size decreases and tends to zero within its
optimal limits, the accuracy of the solutions improves, but the computational cost increases. The degree of
freedom needed for model computation significantly impacts time and memory use. It is typically
advantageous to estimate the degrees of freedom by considering the number of mesh elements in the
model. Hence, a mesh independence analysis has been performed on CS-2 over the entire computational
domain using a non-uniform triangular mesh to evaluate the trade-o ffbetween the accuracy of the solution
and computational cost.
Table A1 presents pertinent data regarding the quantity of elements, degrees of freedom, and the
maximum electric field intensity within the cell. The present study has noted an increase in the
computational cost as a result of the irregular structure of the microtubules and shapes of the mitochondria.
This ultimately leads to an increase in both the number of elements and the degrees of freedom, as
depicted in Figure A1. The trend observed is that the maximum electric field intensity value exhibits an
increasing pattern as the number of elements increases up to 1650073. After that, the changes in the
solution are negligible in terms of the maximum electric field intensity and relative percentage error. For
instance, at 1653103 elements, and the maximum electric field intensity value is 5.887 V /m, with a relative
percentage error of 0.0033. Therefore, in order to optimize computational e fforts and cost, the total
number of elements selected and all subsequent results presented in this work have been given for 1653103
elements and the degrees of freedom, 10817040. The mesh independence analysis for CS-1 has been
conducted in a separate study [58].
