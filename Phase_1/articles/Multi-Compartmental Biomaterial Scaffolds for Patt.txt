Abstract 
 
Biomaterials are becoming an essential tool in the study and application of stem cell research.  Vario us types of 
biomaterials enable three-dimensional (3D) culture of stem cells, and, more recently, also enable high -resolution 
patterning and organization of multicellular archit ectures. Biomaterials also hold potential to provid e many 
additional advantages over cell transplants alone i n regenerative medicine. This paper describes novel  designs for 
functionalized biomaterial constructs that guide ti ssue development to targeted regional identities an d structures. 
Such designs comprise compartmentalized regions in the biomaterial structure that are functionalized w ith 
molecular factors that form concentration gradients  through the construct and guide stem cell developm ent, axis 
patterning, and tissue architecture, including rost ral/caudal, ventral/dorsal, or medial/lateral ident ities of the central 
nervous system. The ability to recapitulate innate developmental processes in a 3D environment and und er specific 
controlled conditions has vital application to adva nced models of neurodevelopment and for repair of s pecific sites of 
damaged or diseased neural tissue.

Introduction 
 
It has long been recognized that stem cells hold tr emendous therapeutic potential for a variety of dis eases and 
injuries, particularly for numerous ailments that h ave no effective treatments, but restoring tissue a nd organ 
functions with stem cells has also posed several ch allenges that remain to be overcome, including suff icient cell 
survival, development, and functional integration i n native tissues. One approach for surmounting many  of these 
limitations and significantly advancing capabilitie s of stem cells in therapeutic applications is the use of stem cells 
cultured in biomaterial architecture. Biomaterials offer numerous advantages and expand capabilities t hat generally 
cannot be achieved with stem cells alone, particula rly in the case of implanting cells and reconstruct ing damaged 
tissue.  
 
Biomaterials generally include natural or synthetic  matrix molecules (or a modified combination of the  two) that 
replicate aspects of innate extracellular matrix in  various tissues. This biomaterial scaffolding can serve many 
functions, such as supporting structural organizati on and patterning of cells, providing molecular and  mechanical 
differentiation cues, arranging attachment points f or cells and aiding anchorage-dependent survival, a s well as 
preventing cells from being washed away from implan tation sites in the body [1]. Many types of biomate rials have 
been shown to influence the survival and function o f developing stem cells, and biomaterial designs ca n help 
replicate cellular interactions, matrix characteris tics, biochemical gradients, and signaling events t hat occur in 
development, in addition to supporting cell surviva l, differentiation, and integration into innate tis sue.  2 
 The suspension of stem cells in biomaterial polymer s and aqueous media thus enables the formation of u nique 
structures and functions found in many types of org an tissues. One example of this is cerebral organoi ds, where 
clusters of pluripotent stem cells are cultured in spheres of proteinaceous Matrigel to create numerou s types of neural 
structures and cell types [2]. 3D hydrogel cultures  of stem cells have been shown to enable the format ion of other 
advanced anatomical structures, including various g astrointestinal, hepatic, pancreatic, renal, retina l, and neural 
tissues. The cells themselves appear to possess inn ately-programmed capabilities to self-assemble at l east some 
aspects of important anatomical structures even in unpatterned hydrogel constructs. For example, neura l tissue 
organoids have demonstrated various aspects of vent ricular, hippocampal, retinal, spinal, and cortical  regions, and 
such organoid constructs are being used to identify  previously unknown mechanisms of neurological dise ases like 
microcephaly, autism, neurodegenerative diseases, z ika virus infection, and others [2-6] as well as to  investigate 
normal tissue development [7-9].  
 
Importantly, the use of biomaterials in clinically- relevant testing has also shown promise in enhancin g cell survival 
and cell migration at the implantation site [10-12] , promoting a favorable regenerative environment [1 3], and 
extending neural connectivity through neural lesion s [14]. The presence of hydrogel materials loaded w ith 
neurotrophic factors and implanted in ischemic brai n tissue can enhance cell survival, axonal sproutin g, and 
migration of immature neuronal cells around the str oke area [12]. Thus engineered tissues hold great p otential in 
regenerative medicine, but one of the weaknesses of  stem-cell-derived tissues is the lack of comprehen sive control 
over specific regional identities, architectures, a nd cellular sub-specializations in the biomaterials . Accurate 
replication of complex structures like cortex, hipp ocampus, retina, tracts, or other neuroanatomy cann ot yet be 
entirely controlled or achieved and each organoid m ay vary significantly in the resulting composition of cell types, 
structures, and self-organization patterns.  
 
Synthesis of Form and Function 
 
Because a simple homogenous biomaterial sphere is l ikely not sufficient to consistently guide all type s of cellular self-
organization and tissue patterning in organoids, ad vancing technologies seek to enable composite bioma terials to 
provide more detailed guidance of cellular architec ture and identity. This may be accomplished through  a variety of 
means. The architecture of a biomaterial construct,  for example, can be formed with committed or restr icted neural 
stem cells capable of forming diverse neuroglial su btypes and the inclusion of patterned fiber scaffol ds suspended in 
the biomaterial can guide and enhance cell attachme nt and neurite outgrowth along the fibers [11, 15].  Hydrogels 
functionalized with axonal guidance molecules may e nhance cellular attachment, migration, differentiat ion, and 
axonal extension, and hydrogels seeded with disease d cells can replicate innate pathological features of diseases like 
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease [2-4, 16]. Char acteristics like biomaterial stiffness, density, an d cross-linking 
capability can influence cell differentiation and f unction [17], and a wide array of tissue types and cell states may be 
achieved with the choice of biomaterial, either by means of intrinsic cell signals or by means of vari ous growth 
factors and differentiation factors that can be sup plied within the biomaterials.  
 
In addition, biomaterials may be designed to enhanc e the biocompatibility of tissue implants. Certain types of matrix 
molecules may inhibit inflammatory and scarring rea ctions that arise from disrupting tissue or introdu cing a foreign 
body into the tissue, either by interacting with ce llular receptors or by absorbing and diffusing reac tive cell signaling 
factors. If the biomaterial takes too long to degra de or has too great of stiffness compared with the innate tissue, it 
may trigger foreign body reactions that prevent fun ctional integration of the implanted cells, and con versely, if the 
biomaterial degrades too quickly or is too soft or friable, it may not adequately support functional i ntegration of 
implanted cells into the tissue. Thus biomaterial p olymers must be optimized to facilitate integration  into host tissue, 
minimize foreign-body reactions, and enhance the pe rmissive environment of the tissue.  
 
The Role of Diffusion 
 
Recent research has suggested that the inherent diff usion limitations of gasses, nutrients, and signali ng molecules 
through 3D tissue cultures can specifically affect cellular organization, differentiation state, and m etabolic 
characteristics of cells [18]. While this phenomeno n can impede important oxygen and nutrient delivery  to cells in a 
3D environment, it can also be advantageously used to replicate molecular concentration gradients in s ynthetic 3D 3 
 tissue constructs. In other words, the biomaterial can serve to enclose and contain local regions with  concentration 
gradients of certain factors in the construct that may be endogenously secreted by cells or that may b e introduced 
artificially. Such a capability is vital for replic ating innate gradients and cues that occur in early  tissue development 
or that may play a role in certain pathological con ditions, and by forming compartments of diffusing f actors in the 
biomaterial construct, concentration gradients can be formed to drive stem cell differentiation and gu ide tissue 
development. These concentration gradients may be f ormed of trophic factors, migratory cues, neurite g uidance 
signals, hormones, nutrients, or other factors that  affect tissue patterning and cell identity at dist inct regions of a 
tissue construct. Understanding these diffusion sig nals and processes will better help deliver specifi c controllable 
concentrations of ions, nutrients, and other factor s to specific regions of the cellular tissue constr ucts, which in turn 
will enable tight control of cell state and differe ntiation processes. Evidence also suggests that ste m cells implanted 
into the body may have better survival if they are cultured and prepared under certain conditions of h ypoxic stress 
or ischemic exposure, a form of “preconditioning” t he cells [19], and culturing cells in 3D conditions  with limited 
diffusion is one way of achieving the preconditioni ng effect for regenerative cell therapy application s. 
 
3D Biomaterial Scaffolding Designs 
 
Several examples of 3D biomaterial designs are give n herein that comprise distinct nanoarchitecture, f unctionalized 
compartments, and microgradients in the tissue cons truct [Fig. 1]. These designs provide detailed cont rol of cell 
differentiation and tissue structure, and several e xamples are described demonstrating how certain inn ate 
neurodevelopmental cues can be mimicked in a 3D tis sue construct [Fig. 2] and how regional patterning of cortical 
tissue can be influenced with applied gradients of signaling factors [Fig. 3].  
 
 
Figure 1: Examples of various organoid scaffolding designs created with biomaterial hydrogels and poly mer 
fibers. (A) represents the standard organoid matrix  droplet in which cellular spheroids are placed for  
organoid differentiation. (B-G) represent more comp lex designs with two or more distinct regions or 
4 
 polarized compartments in the biomaterial, such as where an external hydrogel layer is loaded with sig naling 
molecules, growth factors, or functionalized fibers  and then coated around the inner hydrogel sphere. Each 
compartment is used to create certain effects—for e xample, in (B) the upper compartment may be 
biochemically functionalized with rostral-inducing factors while the lower compartment may be 
functionalized with caudal-inducing factors. As ano ther example, in (C) the lower and upper compartmen ts 
may be functionalized with ventral-dorsal direction al gradients  and the remaining central and outer 
compartments may be functionalized in a lateral-med ial-lateral manner, as described in the text. The 
compartments of the hydrogel may be directly loaded  with corresponding signaling factors to create 
concentration gradients, or the fibers or hydrogel polymers themselves may be functionalized with the desired 
signaling factor. Fibers are about a micron in diam eter while the tissue constructs are a few millimet ers in 
diameter, and thus the figures are not to scale.  
 
Though appearing complicated, these designs may be constructed through relatively simple means. Bioche mical 
signaling factors (which may include differentiatio n cues, patterning factors, axonal guidance molecul es, growth 
factors, or others) are loaded or mixed into specif ic compartments of biomaterial hydrogel at desired initial 
concentrations, and these then diffuse and form spe cific concentration gradients through the biomateri al construct. 
These concentration gradient profiles of the signal ing factors through the spatial coordinates of the construct over 
time were recently derived and published, including  for scenarios of a limited supply of diffusant mol ecules (like 
certain signaling factors or glucose in media) or f or an unlimited diffusant supply (like oxygen in cu lture), and with 
or without metabolism of the diffusant by cells in the 3D tissue construct [18].  
 
Functionalized nanofibers themselves may also be su spended within or through the 3D hydrogel (as in Fi gures 1D-
G), the method of which has been described previous ly [15]. Functionalized fibers may also be rolled i nto the 
hydrogel (as in Figure 1E), and the biomaterial lay ers of the construct may be assembled in stages rat her than all at 
once, in order, for example, to add external signal ing gradients at later time points in the culture. The nanofibers are 
functionalized by coating biochemical factors direc tly onto the polymer fibers. If coating by adsorpti ve methods, the 
factors may then diffuse from the fibers into the h ydrogel compartments, or if coating by more permane nt chemical 
coupling methods, guidance molecules or attachment domains remain bound to the polymer fibers. By expl oring a 
variety of factors and arrangements, such construct s enable detailed study of what signals and structu res are 
necessary and sufficient (and what signals are infl uential but non-essential) for neurodevelopmental p rocesses like 
cell sub-specialization, axis patterning, regionali zation, and architecture formation.  
 
Biochemically-active molecules that serve as differ entiation and patterning factors can guide tissue c onstruct 
polarization and axis patterning by being incorpora ted into specific regions of the hydrogel. Diffusiv e gradients of 
these factors can then be established in a similar orientation to innate biochemical gradients that ar e known to 
influence developmental processes in central neural  tissue. For example, in the brain and spinal cord,  ventralization 
effects and the corresponding neural and astroglial  identities may be achieved by incorporating ventra lization factors 
like sonic hedgehog protein (SHH), smoothened agoni st (SAG), or purmorphamine into a hydrogel compartm ent [20-
23]. Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF-8) can be adde d to induce midbrain dopaminergic identity [24-26].  Dorsalization 
effects in the tissue construct may likewise be ach ieved with “wnt” protein (WNT), bone morphogenetic protein 4 
(BMP-4), cyclopamine, or others. WNT actually plays  a complex role and may help to induce certain dors alization, 
caudalization, or ventralization effects depending on context [22, 27-32]. Similarly, the family of fi broblast growth 
factors (FGFs) can play varied roles in caudalizati on, rostralization, ventralization, and dorsalizati on [33-35]. Other 
small molecule inhibitors of the above-mentioned pa thways can also be used to divert commitment toward s opposite 
fates—for example, while WNT, BMP, and nodal can in duce caudal fates, WNT inhibitors, BMP inhibitors, and nodal 
inhibitors may be implemented to drive a rostral fa te. Thus signaling molecule gradients in synthetic forms can be 
used to recapitulate the natural directional gradie nts of SHH, WNT, BMP, and FGFs that are essential i n proper 
neural tissue development.

Most regionalization factors, however, cannot simpl y be partitioned into clear categorical effects sin ce they have 
interacting effects and depend substantially on tim ing, concentration, and cell state. For example, ov er decades of 
research work on neurodevelopment, it was found tha t endogenous inhibition of the BMP molecule was req uired for 
the formation of neural cells from the early ectode rmal layer in many developing species from amphibia ns to 
mammals [36-37]. Through the 1990s and early 2000s it was found that inhibitors of BMP signaling (such  as 
dorsomophin, noggin, chordin, and follistatin) as w ell as inhibitors of TGF-β (such as SB-431542) coul d be used in the 
culture of stem cells to promote neural differentia tion. Further research suggested that these signali ng pathways, 
while necessary for neural induction, were not enti rely sufficient. More complex roles were found for FGF signaling, 
WNT signaling, and retinoic acid (RA) signaling, eac h of which could influence neural differentiation b ased on the 
timing and concentration of signaling factors [2, 3 8-40],. FGF signaling has some downstream effects on inhi biting 
BMP and SMAD family member proteins, but FGF also p roduces a neural fate independently of BMP or SMAD 
modulation [38]. FGF appears to have numerous effec ts, including promoting neural induction, promoting  
proliferation of neural stem cells, promoting a cau dal fate, and, if the cells have already committed to a cerebral fate, 
promoting a ventral forebrain identity [41].  
6 
 Retinoic acid can also induce neuroglial lineage in the brain [42], with high concentrations tending to  produce 
neurons that are representative of the caudal porti on of the brain and spinal cord [41, 43-44] (simila r to the 
caudalizing effects of FGF-2), although again its e ffects depend on concentration, timing, and current  state of the 
cells. Early exposure of neural progenitor cells to  high levels of RA tends to promote posteriorization , while 
activation of SHH signaling promotes ventralization . It has been found that RA can promote SHH activity , and 
gradients of both RA and SHH are important for the i nduction of the ‘floor plate,’ a tissue structure a t the front of the 
neural tube that helps signal ventral-dorsal patter ning of the cells within the cord. In the spinal co rd, these factors are 
influential in driving ventral motor neuron identit y and central interneuron identity [7]. RA also inte racts with WNT 
by altering gene promoter assembly and activating a lternate, non-canonical WNT pathways (such as diffe rentiation 
signals) rather than canonical WNT pathways (such a s maintenance of stemness) [45].  
 
During development the meningeal layers that surrou nd the brain play a significant role in neurodevelo pment by 
providing retinoic acid signaling and chemoattracta nt signals that aid outer attachment of radial glia l fibers and by 
promoting the migration of neural cells to the cort ex [2, 46-47]. The dura, which is the most outer la yer of the 
meninges, also secretes FGF-2 and TGF-β related mol ecules that aid in the initiation of bone plates th at become the 
skull. As neural stem cells migrate from central pr ogenitor regions along spoke-like radial glia to po pulate the outer 
rims that will become cortex, network connections b oth near and far also begin to form.  
 
Also early in development of the brain, reelin is e xpressed and secreted from Cajal-Retzius neurons, wh ich are the 
primary cells found in the outer layer I of the ear ly-developing cortex. It is thought that reelin hel ps guide radial glia 
fibers to extend outwardly towards the edges of the  brain where cortex and hippocampus will eventually  be formed 
[48-53], and reelin enables neurons and neural prog enitors to release from radial glia fibers and migr ate throughout 
the cortex [51, 54-55]. It has also been shown that  reelin is essential for neuronal positioning in co rtex and spinal cord 
[51, 56], where cortical and hippocampal fibers ori ent along the reelin gradient [48, 53]. A lack of r eelin causes 
lissencephaly or agyria, likely due to the fact tha t radial glia scaffolding that neurons rely on for migration to the 
cortex is deformed and cannot provide the proper gu ide for neural precursors [49-50, 52].  
 
Reelin has also been implicated in diseases like Alz heimer’s, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and other disord ers [57-61]. The 
mechanisms involved are varied, but appear to invol ve interactions among reelin-responsive domains in 
apolipoprotein E receptors and very low-density lip oprotein receptors, which have been shown to be inv olved in 
radial migration of neuronal precursors and detachm ent of such precursors from migratory chains [62]. Reelin also 
can promote dendritic growth and strengthen long-te rm potentiation by influencing N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA) 
receptors [63-68], and it is thought that reelin in creases the mobilization of the NMDA receptors such  that they 
“float” among the lipid molecules of the membrane r ather than being anchored to the architecture of th e cell. The 
ability to influence membrane mobility allows reeli n to control subunit expression within NMDA recepto rs after 
early development [69], and this may allow the NMDA  receptor to mature more quickly, since the maturat ion of the 
NMDA receptor involves replacing the NR2B subunit w ith the NR2A subunit [70].  
 
As brain development proceeds, signals that control  area specification continue in complexity, and the  cells of the 
brain not only possess the machinery for all the ex traordinary functions of thought and memory, but al so the 
incredible capability to self-organize and assemble  its complex pathways and networks. Numerous transc ription 
factors determine finely detailed patterns of brain  development and spatial identity. One of the more simple 
examples from this complexity is found in the dueli ng roles of Emx2 and Pax6. In the 3D environment of  the brain, 
Emx2 directs the development of the caudal-medial r egion while Pax6 directs the rostral-lateral region  of the cortex. 
Each of these factors inhibits the other, thereby m aking a strong gradient of Pax6 in one region and a  strong gradient 
of Emx2 in the opposite region. If either one of th ese factors is inactive or mutated, the cortical re gion it is responsible 
for will be underdeveloped and the opposing region will overgrow [71-73]. Expression of both Pax6 and Emx2 is 
strongly influenced by concentrations of previously  mentioned factors like SHH (which represses Pax6) and FGFs 
(like FGF-8 which represses Emx2) [33, 74-75], mean ing that although simple regional gradients can be generated in 
organoid constructs, additional downstream gradient s of signaling factors may complicate or interweave  with 
intended results.  
 7 
 As can be seen, investigating the function of just a single type of diffusing signaling factor in the brain can be quite 
complex, meaning that assembling the roles of thous ands of possible variations is a daunting task, but  the advent of 
these 3D tissue designs enables a platform for cont rolled study of individual factors in neural develo pment and 
disease. Recent work suggests that the cortex has at  least 180 distinct and conserved areas [76], the i dentities and 
structures of which must be shaped from a variety o f signaling cues. The ability to replicate these in nate 
neurodevelopmental processes and three-dimensional compositions in the lab with known gradients and lo calized 
concentrations of molecular signaling factors is es sential for directed specification and accurate stu dy of stem cell 
development and thus vital to the targeted regenera tion of functional neural tissue.  
 
Conclusions 
 
When attempting to design ideal cellular constructs  for implantation, numerous aspects must be careful ly considered 
in the context of the specific tissue type and the desired functional effects. Restoring function in ti ssues and organs—
whether brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, nerve, m uscle, or other tissues—is likely to require integr ating and 
reconstructing functional architecture of the tissu e rather than simply implanting isolated cells. Rece nt stem cell 
research has therefore focused on the application o f biomaterials along with stem cells to enable desi red patterning 
and organization of more accurate and complete tiss ue structures. The tissue construct designs present ed herein 
enable an array of important investigations in tiss ue development, disease mechanisms, environmental t oxicologies, 
and regenerative medicine applications.   
 
Nevertheless, much research remains to be done on t he optimal combinations of biomaterials, signaling factors, and 
scaffolding architectures needed to optimally prepa re cells for transplantation and integration into s pecific tissues of 
the body. This work describes novel biomaterial des igns for controlling critical processes of neurodev elopment, 
within which molecular signaling gradients may be e stablished according to physical diffusion models. It is not yet 
known to what extent neural networks can be functio nally established in 3D tissue constructs, or wheth er 3D 
architecture can be integrated into the prohibitive  in vivo  central nervous system environment, but the abilit y to 
accurately replicate neuroanatomical structures and  guide neural network formation in three dimensions , both in 
vitro  and in vivo , will produce major advances in the field of neura l regeneration.
