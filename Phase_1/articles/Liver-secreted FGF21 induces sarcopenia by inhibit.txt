Title: Liver-secreted FGF21 induces sarcopenia by inhibiting satellite cell myogenesis via klotho beta in decompensated cirrhosis.
Abstract: Sarcopenia, a prevalent condition, significantly impacts the prognosis of patients with decompensated cirrhosis (DC). Serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels are significantly higher in DC patients with sarcopenia. Satellite cells (SCs) play a role in aging- and cancer-induced sarcopenia. Here, we investigated the roles of FGF21 and SCs in DC-related sarcopenia as well as the underlying mechanisms.
