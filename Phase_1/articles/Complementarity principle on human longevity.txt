Abstract 
In recent we introduced, developed and established a new concept, model, methodology 
and principle for studying human longevity in terms of demographic basis. We call the 
new model the “Weon model”, which is a general model modified from the Weibull 
model with an age-dependent shape parameter to describe human survival and mortality 
curves. We demonstrate the application of the Weon model to the mortality dynamics 
and the mathematical limit of longevity (the mortality rate to be mathematically zero, 
implying a maximum longevity) in the Section I. The mathematical limit of longevity 
can be induced by the mortality dynamics in nature. As a result, we put forward the 
complementarity principle, which explains the recent paradoxical trends that the 
mathematical limit decreases as the longevity increases, in the Section II. Our findings 
suggest that the human longevity can be limited by the complementarity principle. 2 Acknowledgements

Summary 
In this Section, we wish to show that the mortality dynamics is a consequence of the 
bending of the shape parameter at old ages. This investigation is based upon the Weon 
model (the Weibull model with an age-dependent shape parameter) for human survival 
and mortality curves. According to the Weon model, we are well able to describe the 
mortality decrease after the mortality plateau, including the mortality deceleration. 
Furthermore, we are able to simply define the mathematical limit of longevity by the 
mortality decrease. From the demographic analysis of the historical trends in 
Switzerland (1876-2001) and Sweden (1861-2001), and the most recent trends in the 
other eleven developed countries (1996-2001), we confirm that the bending of the shape 
parameter after characteristic life is correlated with the mortality deceleration (or 
decrease). As a consequence, this bending of the shape parameters and the mortality 
deceleration is associated with the mathematical limit on longevity. These results 
suggest that the mathematical limit of longevity can be induced by the mortality 
deceleration (or decrease) in nature. 4 1. Introduction 
Fundamental studies of the aging process have lately attracted the interest of 
researchers in a variety of disciplines, linking ideas and theories from such diverse 
fields as biochemistry to mathematics (Weitz and Fraser 2001). The way to characterize 
aging is to plot the increase in mortality rate with chronological age. The mortality rate 
is the probability that an individual who is alive at a particular age will die during the 
following age interval. The mortality rate can also be represented as the fraction of the 
population surviving to a particular age (or the survival rate).  
The fundamental law of population dynamics is the Gompertz law (Gompertz 
1825), in which the human mortality rate increases roughly exponentially with 
increasing age at senescence. The Gompertz model is most commonly employed to 
compare mortality rates between different populations (Penna and Stauffer 1996). 
However, no mathematical model so far, including the Gompertz model, has been 
suggested that can perfectly approximate the development of the mortality rate over the 
total life span (Kowald 1999). Particularly in modern research findings, it seems to be 
obvious that the mortality rate does not increase according to the Gompertz model at the 
highest ages (Vaupel 1997; Robine and Vaupel 2002), and this deviation from the 
Gompertz model is a great puzzle to demographers, biologists and gerontologists. There 
are two standard hypotheses that have been put forward to explain this phenomenon: the 
individual-risk hypothesis and the heterogeneity hypothesis (Higgins 2003). This puzzle 
needs to be resolved.  
There is strong evidence from many developed countries that the rate of increase 
in mortality decelerates at high ages. However, many of the traditional mathematical 
models (for instance, the Gompertz, Weibull, Heligman & Pollard, Kannisto, Quadratic 5 and Logistic models) for the mortality rate provide poor fits to empirical population data 
at the highest ages (Thatcher, Kannisto and Vaupel 1998; Yi and Vaupel 2003). We 
have recently found a useful model derived from the Weibull model with an age-
dependent shape parameter to describe the human survival and mortality curves (Weon 
2004a, 2004b).  
The model suggests that the mortality deceleration (or decrease) at old ages is a 
consequence of the bending of the shape parameter (Weon 2004a). We are able to apply 
the model to describe the mortality deceleration (or decrease) at older ages. In this 
investigation, we wish to demonstrate the mortality deceleration (or decrease) by the 
bending of the shape parameter through the demographic analysis of the historical 
trends in Switzerland (1876-2001) and Sweden (1861-2001), and the most recent trends 
in the other eleven developed countries (1996-2001). In fact, the mortality rate 
decelerates at higher ages, reaching perhaps a maximum or ceiling around age 110 
(Vaupel et al. 1998; Helfand and Inouye 2002). We will show that the new model 
enables us to describe the mortality dynamics at the highest ages. 
 
2. Weon model 
We have put forward a general expression for human survival and mortality rate 
in our previous papers (Weon 2004a, 2004b). It has been recently discovered that 
human survival and mortality curves are well described by the following new 
mathematical model, derived from the Weibull survival function and it is simply 
described by two parameters, the age-dependent shape parameter and characteristic life, 
as follows, 
 6 ))/( exp()(tt Sba- =  (1) 
 
where S denotes the survival probability of surviving to age t, a denotes 
characteristic life and )(tb  denotes the shape parameter as a function of age. The 
original idea was obtained as follows: typical human survival curves show i) a rapid 
decrease in survival in the first few years of life and ii) a relatively steady decrease and 
then an abrupt decrease near death thereafter (see Fig. 1 in Weon 2004a; Azbel 2002). 
Interestingly, the former behaviour resembles the Weibull survival function with 1<b  
and the latter behaviour seems to follow the case of 1>>b . With this in mind, it could 
be assumed that shape parameter is a function of age. The new model is completely 
different from the Weibull model in terms of the ‘age dependence of the shape 
parameter’. It is especially noted that the shape parameter ‘ )/ln(/)ln ln( )( a b t S t - = ’ 
can indicate a ‘rectangularity’ of the survival curve. The reason for this is that as the 
value of the shape parameter becomes a high value, the shape of the survival curve 
approaches a further rectangular shape. We will call the new model the ‘Weon model’ 
hereafter.  
The Weibull model for technical devices has a constant shape parameter, 
whereas the Weon model for humans has an age-dependent shape parameter; 
))/( exp(bat S - =  for technical devices (the Weibull model) and ))/( exp()(tt Sba- =  
for humans (the Weon model). In the Weon model, the shape parameter for humans, 
‘ )/ln(/)ln ln( )( a b t S t - = ’, is a function of age t. Therefore, the mortality function is 
described by the mathematical relationship with the survival function ( dtSd /ln-=m ) 
and is in general as follows, 7 ))/(()(ttdtdba m=  or ])()/ln()([ )/()(
dttdttttt baba mb´ + ´ =  (2) 
 
where m is the mortality rate (denoted as the hazard rate or the force of mortality), 
meaning the relative rate for the survival function decrease. Obviously, mortality trends 
should be directly associated with shape parameter trends. It is noteworthy that the ‘age 
dependence of the shape parameter’ intrinsically makes the mortality function complex 
and difficult for modeling.  
Conveniently, the value of characteristic life (a) is always found at the duration 
for survival to be ‘ )1 exp(-’; this is known as the characteristic life. This feature gives 
the advantage of looking for the value of a simply by a graphical analysis of the 
survival curve. In turn, with the observed value of a, we can plot ‘rectangularity’ with 
age by the mathematical equivalence of ‘ )/ln(/)ln ln( )( a b t S t - = ’. If )(tb  is not 
constant with age, this obviously implies that ‘ )(tb  is a function of age’. On the other 
hand, )(tb  mathematically approaches infinity as the age t approaches the value of a 
or the denominator ‘ )/ln(at ’ approaches zero. This feature of )(tb  can leave ‘traces of 
a’ in the plot of )(tb , so we can observe variations of )(tb  and a at once in the plot 
of the shape parameters. If )(tb  (except for the mathematical singularity (traces of a)) 
can be expressed by an adequate mathematical function, the survival and mortality 
functions can be calculated by the mathematically expressed )(tb . Only two parameters, 
)(tb  and a, determine the survival and mortality functions. In empirical practice, we 
could use a linear expression for the mature phase (middle age) and a quadratic 
expression for senescence phase (from characteristic life to maximum age): 8 ... )(2
2 1 0 + + + = t t t b b b b , where the associated coefficients were determined by a 
regression analysis in the plot of shape parameter curve. And thus, the derivative of 
)(tb  was obtained as follows: ... 2 /)(2 1 + + = t dttd b b b , which is the important finding 
in the previous papers (Weon 2004a, 2004b), that is, the shape parameter for humans is 
a function of age.  
 
3. An approximate relationship between the mortality rate and the shape 
parameter 
We are able to observe a certain degree of universality for the linear progression 
of the shape parameter for ages earlier than characteristic life in many modern 
developed countries. Figure 1A shows that in thirteen developed countries (Austria 
1999, Canada 1996, Denmark 2000, England & Wales 1998, Finland 2000, Italy 1999, 
Germany 1999, Japan 1999, Netherlands 1999, Norway 2000, Sweden 2001, 
Switzerland 2001 and USA 1999), the shape parameter for ages 0 up to 80 was 
estimated to be t t 08581 .0 44578 .1)( + = b . It was shown in the previous paper (Weon 
2004a), that these countries have a characteristic life of more than 80 years. Using this 
universality of )(tb , we could simulate the relationship of the mortality deceleration 
and the shape parameter in the following way. 
For our analysis, we separately evaluate the impact of the mathematical terms 
on the mortality rate as follows, 
 
BA´=m ; where )()/(tt Aba =  and ])()/ln()([dttdtttBbab´ + =  (3) 9 In Fig. 1B, since the term B is almost invariant after adulthood (~20+), the result is that 
we could obtain the approximate relationship of the mortality rate (log-scale) and the 
shape parameter (linear-scale) after adulthood. 
 
)( ln tbmµ  (4) 
 
This relationship implies that the mortality rate would follow the Gompertz law 
(exponential growth in the mortality rate with age), when the shape parameter is linearly 
proportional to age, but the mortality rate would deviate from the Gompertz law when 
the shape parameter is bent (non-linear) with age.  
Furthermore, the age dependence of the shape parameter, )(tb , for population 
dynamics may be a general law that includes the Gompertz model and the Weibull 
model: i) the Gompertz model when )(tb  is linearly proportional to age and ii) the 
Weibull model when )(tb  is a constant. The Gompertz model (Gompertz 1825) and the 
Weibull model (Weibull 1951) are the most generally used models at present (Gavrilov 
and Gavrilova 2001). Interestingly, the Gompertz model is more commonly used to 
describe biological systems, whereas the Weibull model is more commonly applicable 
to technical devices (Gavrilov and Gavrilova 2001). Particularly for aging patterns, it is 
the shape parameter that distinguishes humans from technical devices. It seems to show 
the difference between humans and technical devices in terms of ‘robustness’. The 
fundamental difference for robustness between biological systems and technical devices 
is obvious (Gavrilov and Gavrilova 2001). In the previous papers (Weon 2004a, 2004b), 
the age-dependent shape parameter is changed from approximately 0.5 to 10 with age 10 for the typical human survival curves. This feature is in great contrast to technical 
devices typically having a constant shape parameter (Nelson 1990). We attribute the age 
dependence of the shape parameter to the resistance to aging, which can be described as 
a struggle to extend the survival probability by increasing the shape parameter, or the 
homeostasis and the adaptation of biological systems, which must have the homeostasis 
and the adaptation to maintain stability and to survive (Weon 2004a). 
For humans over much of the age range, the Gompertz model still gives an 
excellent approximation. At the high ages, however, the law does not apply very well 
(Thatcher, Kannisto and Vaupel 1998). In the Weon model, a linear expression for the 
shape parameter is appropriate before characteristic life and a quadratic expression is 
appropriate after characteristic life for the modern demographic curves (Weon 2004a). 
The age-dependent shape parameter in the Weon model can be seen as a measure of the 
deviation from the Gompertz law at senescence and the mortality deceleration at high 
ages.  
 
4. A mathematical limit of longevity by mortality decrease 
In order to model the mortality rate after characteristic life (or at the high ages), 
we should model the shape parameter accurately. For example in Fig. 2A, we plotted 
)(tb  after the characteristic life in Switzerland (1876-2001); sometimes we had to omit 
several points close to the characteristic life to ensure the quality of the regression 
analysis. Also, we accomplished the regression analysis to confirm the best 
mathematical model for )(tb . In this case, we used a quadratic expression for )(tb . In 
this way, in Fig. 2B, we examined the demographic data from Sweden (1861-2001). The 
detailed results of the regression analysis are recorded in Table 1 (Switzerland) and 11 Table 2 (Sweden).  
The mathematical model for )(tb  enables us to model the mortality rate after 
characteristic life. We are able to see the example of modeling m through modeling 
)(tb  for Switzerland (2002) and Sweden (2002) in Fig. 3A and 3B. It is especially 
noted that in Fig. 3B, the mortality rate shows the decrease after a plateau around ages 
110-115 and this shows the emergence of the mathematical limit around ages 120-130. 
The following way is convenient to evaluate the mathematical limit. The 
mortality rate should be mathematically positive ( 0>m ); since the term A is always 
positive ( 0>A ), thus the term B should be positive ( 0>B ) in the Eq. (3). Therefore, 
the criterion for the mathematical limit of longevity, implying the ultimate limit of 
longevity which is able to be determined by the mortality dynamics, can be given by, 
 
)/ln()( )(
ab b
ttt
dttd->  (5) 
 
For analysis, the left term denotes the term C and the right term denotes the term D. In 
order to evaluate the mathematical limit of longevity, the age-dependent shape 
parameter after characteristic life must be accurately modeled. In the previous paper 
(Weon 2004a), we successfully used the quadratic expression (2
2 1 0 )( t t t b b b b + + = ) 
for the estimation of the shape parameter after characteristic life in the case of the years 
of 1876-2001 in Switzerland. Interestingly, the quadratic coefficient (2b) supports the 
bending of the shape parameter, which would be directly associated with the mortality 
deceleration as discussed above. Furthermore, the quadratic coefficient (2b) is 12 important to evaluate the mathematical limit of longevity, since it determines the slope 
with age in the derivative ( t2 12b b+ ) of the quadratic expression of the shape 
parameter or in the term C. 
 
5. Demographic evidence in Switzerland and Sweden 
Demographic data, the period life tables (all sexes, 1x1) for the years of 1876-
2001 in Switzerland and for the years of 1861-2001 in Sweden, were taken from the 
Human Mortality Database (available at http://www.mortality.org). We calculated the 
trend lines for the shape parameters after characteristic life in Table 1 (Switzerland) and 
Table 2 (Sweden) by the quadratic expression for the shape parameter. We could see 
that the estimated quadratic expression for the shape parameter is very accurate 
according to the high value of the coefficient of determinant, 2r, and the extremely low 
P-value (<0.0001).  
In order to evaluate the mathematical limits of recent decades in Switzerland 
and Sweden, we separately calculate the term C and the term D, and then plot the 
mathematical terms as a function of age in Fig. 4A (Switzerland) and 4B (Sweden). The 
term C decreases with increasing age, whereas the term D increases with increasing age. 
Interestingly, the term C tends to become steeper over time in recent decades. The slope 
of the term C is important to evaluate the mathematical limit of longevity. The most 
significant observation is that the mathematical limit of longevity becomes shorter as 
the slope of the term C becomes steeper in Fig. 4A and 4B. This phenomenon, as shown 
in Fig. 5, indicates that the bending of the shape parameter (or the quadratic coefficient) 
is associated with the mathematical limit of longevity, which is due to the mortality 
decrease at the highest ages. The slope of the term C or the quadratic coefficient (2b) 13 tends to increase in recent decades as shown in Fig. 4A and 4B, and in Table 1 and 
Table 2.  
 
6. Demographic evidence in the other eleven countries 
The findings from Switzerland and Sweden are very interesting. We wish to 
expand our investigation to the other eleven developed countries (Austria 1999, Canada 
1996, Denmark 2000, England & Wales 1998, Finland 2000, Italy 1999, Germany 1999, 
Japan 1999, Netherlands 1999, Norway 2000, Sweden 2001, Switzerland 2001 and 
USA 1999) as the most recent trends. Demographic data, the period life tables (all sexes, 
1x1) for the most recent years between 1996-2001 in the eleven developed countries, 
were taken from the Human Mortality Database (available at http://www.mortality.org). 
We calculated the trend lines for the shape parameters after characteristic life in Table 3. 
We could see that the estimated quadratic expression for the shape parameter is very 
accurate according to the high value of the coefficient of the determinant, 2r, and the 
extremely low P-value (<0.0001).  
We accomplished the similar examinations in Fig. 6, 7, and 8. We found out that 
the quadratic expression for )(tb  is appropriate after characteristic life in Fig. 6 for the 
eleven countries. We evaluated the mathematical limits of longevity in Fig. 7. Finally, 
we could obtain the similar phenomenon between the mathematical limits and the 
quadratic coefficient (the bending of the shape parameter) in Fig. 8. These results 
confirm that the bending of the shape parameter after characteristic life is correlated 
with the mortality deceleration (or decrease), and consequently, is associated with the 
mathematical limit of longevity. The findings suggest that the mathematical limit of 
longevity can de induced by the mortality deceleration (or decrease) in nature.  14 7. Discussion 
Vaupel et al. (1998) has suggested that the human mortality rates could 
decrease after having reached a maximum (a plateau or a ceiling of mortality). The 
results reported by Robine and Vaupel (2002) strongly support the finding that the 
mortality rate does not increase according to the Gompertz curve at the highest ages and 
the results are consistent with a plateau around ages 110-115, and their earlier study 
suggests that mortality may fall after age 115. In humans, the deceleration in the 
mortality rate is not seen until after 80 years of age, but a clear deviation from the 
predicted Gompertz model of exponential increases in mortality is observed. If 
individuals such as Jeanne Calment, who lived to the ripe old age of 122 years and 164 
days, are included, then mortality rates are seen to decrease with age after 110 years of 
age (Helfand and Inouye 2002). The Weon model is well able to describe the mortality 
decrease after the mortality plateau, including the mortality deceleration, and further, 
the model predicts the mathematical limit of longevity by the mortality decrease. It may 
be arguable to evaluate the mathematical limit of longevity by the mortality decrease 
based on this assumption, which fit the available data from characteristic life (around 
age 80) up to approaching age 110, and the Weon model will continue to apply up to 
older age. However, the Weon model for mortality rates from the estimation of the 
shape parameter is very reliable in this investigation, so we believe that such 
evaluations are reasonable. 
Yet to our surprise, the trend of the mathematical limit of longevity in recent 
decades seems to be contrary to all our knowledge. We should note that the 
characteristic life in both of Switzerland and Sweden has increased constantly for more 
than a century in Fig. 9, which is consistent with other literature (for instance, Wilmoth 15 et al. 2000; Oeppen and Vaupel 2002; Robine and Vaupel 2002). On the contrary, the 
mathematical limits of longevity by the mortality decrease seem to tend to decrease in 
recent decades. Furthermore, the mathematical limit of longevity in the thirteen 
developed countries approaches approximately 120 to 130 years in recent decades in Fig. 
4 and 5, and Fig. 7 and 8. Interestingly, the bending of the shape parameter tends to be 
more intensive with increasing characteristic life in the previous paper (see Fig. 6 in 
Weon 2004a). This suggests that there probably is an inherent correlation between the 
mortality dynamics and the increase of characteristic life (or longevity tendency). The 
mathematical limit of longevity may be associated with the fundamental principle of 
human longevity. We intend to investigate this question in the Section II. 
 
8. Conclusions 
The age-dependent shape parameter can be a measure of the deviation from the 
Gompertz law at senescence or the mortality deceleration (or decrease) at the highest 
ages. According to the Weon model, we are well able to describe the mortality decrease 
after the mortality plateau, including the mortality deceleration. Furthermore, we are 
able to simply define the mathematical limit of longevity by the mortality decrease. 
From the demographic analysis of the historical trends in Switzerland (1876-2001) and 
Sweden (1861-2001), and the most recent trends in the other eleven developed countries, 
we confirm that the bending of the shape parameter after characteristic life is correlated 
with the mortality deceleration (or decrease) and consequently, it is associated with the 
mathematical limit of longevity. The results suggest that the mathematical limit of 
longevity can be induced by the mortality deceleration (or decrease) in nature. These 
findings will give us a breakthrough to study the mortality dynamics at the highest ages. 16 Section II. Complementarity principle 
 
Summary 
We could see that the longevity and the mathematical limit for humans have 
“complementary” aspects in the Section I. We wish to put forward the complementarity 
principle on human longevity in this Section. This principle is based upon our 
researches by the Weon model (the Weibull model with an age-dependent shape 
parameter) for human survival and mortality curves. In principle for longevity, the 
shape parameter for humans tends to increase for ages before characteristic life but it 
tends to decrease for ages after characteristic life, which is attributable to the nature of 
biological systems to strive to survive healthier and longer. Empirically for ages after 
characteristic life, the shape parameter shows a quadratic expression, in which the 
quadratic coefficient indicates the decrease of the shape parameter and it tends to 
increase with increasing longevity. On the other hand, the quadratic expression is 
related with the mortality deceleration, plateau, and decrease, inducing the mathematical 
limit (the mortality rate to be mathematically zero, implying a maximum longevity). 
Interestingly, the mathematical limit tends to decrease with increasing the quadratic 
coefficient in the Section I. We are able to conclude that the mathematical limit 
decreases as the longevity increases. From the phenomenological explanations about the 
complementarity on longevity and the analysis of the demographic data for Switzerland 
(1876-2002), we come to the conclusion that there would be the complementarity 
between the longevity and the mathematical limit. The complementarity principle 
suggests that the human longevity can be limited. 17 1. Introduction 
In our researches, we introduced, developed and established a new concept, 
model and methodology for studying human longevity in terms of demographic basis. 
We call the new model the “Weon model”, which is a general model modified from the 
Weibull model with an age-dependent shape parameter to describe human survival and 
mortality curves. The Weon model is completely different from the Weibull model in 
terms of the ‘age dependence of the shape parameter’. The shape parameter for humans 
is a function of age is valid for the typical human survival and mortality curves with a 
certain degree of universality in many countries. We evaluate the age dependence of the 
shape parameter to determine an adequate mathematical expression of the shape 
parameter, after determination of the value of the characteristic life graphically in the 
survival curve. The age-dependent shape parameter distinguishes humans (Weon 
model) from technical devices (Weibull model). 
By the way, the latest research left an interesting question for us. According to 
the Section I, the trends of the mathematical limit of longevity in recent decades seem to 
be contrary to all our knowledge. We note that the characteristic life in both of 
Switzerland and Sweden has increased constantly for more than a century, which is 
consistent with other literature (for instance, Wilmoth et al. 2000; Oeppen and Vaupel 
2002; Robine and Vaupel 2002). On the contrary, the mathematical limits of longevity 
seem to tend to decrease in recent decades. Furthermore, the mathematical limits of 
longevity in the thirteen developed countries approach approximately 120 to 130 years 
in recent. Interestingly, the bending of the shape parameter tends to be more intensive 
with increasing characteristic life in the Section I. This result suggests that there 
probably is an inherent correlation between the mortality dynamics and the increase of 18 characteristic life. The mathematical limit of longevity may be associated with the 
fundamental principle of human longevity. We need a consistent answer for this.  
In this Section, we wish to reconsider the origin of the age dependence of the 
shape parameter in the Weon model and the recent paradoxical trends of the longevity 
and the mathematical limit. As a consequence, we find out the complementarity 
principle on human longevity. From the phenomenological explanations about the 
complementarity on longevity and the analysis of the demographic data for Switzerland 
(1876-2002), we come to the conclusion that there would be the complementarity 
between the longevity and the mathematical limit. 
 
2. Complementarity between longevity and limit: phenomenological explanations 
i) A reason for longevity: The essence of the Weon model is the age dependence 
of the shape parameter. What is the origin of the age-dependent shape parameter? In the 
Weon model, the characteristic life (a) in the survival curves has a unique feature, 
which is that all survival curves pass through the characteristic life. So, if the shape 
parameter is constant with age, a higher value of the survival probability (S) at ages 
before characteristic life (a<t ) becomes a lower value of the survival probability (S) 
at ages after characteristic life (a>t ). In principle for the highest value of S or for 
longevity at all times, the shape parameter ( )(tb ) should be variable according to the 
characteristic life (a) as shown in Fig. 10; “for longevity, )(tb  increases at a<t  but it 
decreases at a>t .” Fig. 11 shows a descriptive picture of evolution of )(tb for 
longevity. This is attributable to the nature of biological systems to strive to survive 
healthier and longer. This is a consistent reason for longevity. According to the Weon 
model, empirically the shape parameter shows a quadratic expression, 19 2
2 1 0 )( t t t b b b b + + = , at a>t , in which the quadratic coefficient (2b) indicates the 
decrease of )(tb  at a>t . Thus, the longevity tends to increase with increasing 2b. 
ii) A reason for limit of longevity: In the Section I, we could see that the 
mortality dynamics (deceleration, plateau, and decrease) are a consequence of the 
decrease of the shape parameter at a>t . According to the Weon model, the quadratic 
expression is obviously related with the mortality deceleration, plateau, and decrease, 
inducing the mathematical limit (the mortality rate to be mathematically zero, implying 
a maximum longevity). Interestingly, the mathematical limit tends to decrease with 
increasing quadratic coefficient (2b) in the Section I. Consequently, we are able to 
conclude that the mathematical limit decreases as the longevity increases, which shows 
“complementary” aspects. 
The above phenomenological explanations suggest that there would be the 
complementarity between the longevity and the mathematical limit as shown in Fig. 12. 
It is very interesting that the reason for longevity, especially in terms of the decrease of 
the shape parameter for ages after characteristic life, may be the reason for limit of 
longevity in nature. In the Section I, we could see that the mathematical limit 
approaches around ages 120-130, which can be considered to be a fundamental limit of 
longevity. 
 
3. Demographic evidence for Switzerland 
In the Section I, we analyzed in detail the demographic data for Switzerland 
(1876-2001). In recent we obtained the latest demographic data for Switzerland (2002) 
from the Human Mortality Database (available at http://www.mortality.org). So, we 20 combine the data to demonstrate the demographic evidence for Switzerland over time 
from 1876 up to 2002. 
The age dependence of the shape parameter intrinsically makes the mortality 
function complex and difficult for modeling. Roughly a linear expression is appropriate 
for ages 0-80 (Weon 2004a, 2004b). For the best fits to the demographic data over the 
total life span; a cubic or a quartic expression is appropriate for ages 0-20, a linear or a 
quadratic expression is appropriate for ages 20-80 and a quadratic expression is 
appropriate for ages 80+. We demonstrate an example of modeling the mortality rate 
through the Weon model for Switzerland (2002) in Fig. 13. The best fits for )(tb  in 
Switzerland (2002) are given as follows; 3 200006 .0 00385 .0 1680.0 09605 .1 t t t + - +  
( 9992.02=r ) for ages 0-20, t 09705 .0 05695 .1 +  ( 9975.02=r ) for ages 20-80 and 
200365 .0 72140 .0 08726 .25 t - + -  ( 9559.02=r ) for ages 80-109. 
Specifically, the mortality curves for higher ages (110+) are important to 
understand the longevity. According to the Weon model, the quadratic expression for 
ages 80-109 is valid with a certain degree of university in many modern developed 
countries, which enables us to predict that the mortality rate decreases after a plateau 
around ages 110-115 and the mathematical limit of longevity emerges around ages 120-
130, for example for Switzerland (2002), as shown in Fig. 14. If the quadratic 
expression is valid for ages 110+, we are able to predict the mortality rate at the highest 
ages. This pattern of the mortality dynamics at the highest ages by the Weon model is 
consistent with the other assertions (for instance, Vaupel et al. 1998; Robine and Vaupel 
2002; Helfand and Inouye 2002). 
In the Section I, we successfully used the quadratic expression for the 
description of the shape parameter after ages 80+. Interestingly, the quadratic 21 coefficient is important to evaluate the mathematical limit of longevity, since it 
determines the slope with age in the derivative of the quadratic expression of the shape 
parameter. We are able to see that for longevity, )(tb  increases at a<t  but it 
decreases at a>t  in Fig. 15. We are also able to see that the mathematical limit 
decreases as the characteristic life increases in Fig. 16. 
 
4. Ultimate value of mathematical limit for Switzerland and Sweden 
In Fig. 16, the trend line for the mathematical limit is estimated to be 
) 2308 exp( 2.161 9.1232b´ ´ + =t  ( 9750.02=r ) and the trend line for the longevity 
tendency (characteristic life) is estimated to be 2 6033 58.62 b´ - =t  ( 7307.02=r ). 
Note that 2b is negative in this case. Especially, we are able to predict the ultimate 
value of the mathematical limit as ‘ -¥®2b ’ to be approximately 123.9 years for 
Switzerland, which may be the ultimate limit of longevity for Switzerland. In this way, 
we are able to analyze the case of Sweden (1861-2002) as well as that of Switzerland 
(1876-2002) to estimate the trend line of the mathematical limit for Switzerland and 
Sweden to be ) 2271 exp( 1.161 7.1222b´ ´ + =t  ( 9268.02=r ) in Fig. 17. In this case, 
the ultimate value of the mathematical limit as ‘ -¥®2b ’ is predicted to be 
approximately 122.7 years for Switzerland and Sweden. The cases of Switzerland and 
Sweden are likely to be largely similar to that of the other developed countries. 
Interestingly, this ultimate value for longevity is approximate to the world record for 
human longevity in the case of Jeanne Calment, who lived to the ripe old age of 122 
years and 164 days (122.45 years). 
 22 5. Conclusions 
In this Section, we put forward the complementarity principle on human 
longevity that the longevity and the mathematical limit for humans have 
“complementary” aspects. This principle is the natural and logical consequence of our 
researches by the Weon model (the Weibull model with an age-dependent shape 
parameter). In principle for longevity, the shape parameter for humans tends to increase 
for ages before characteristic life but it tends to decrease for ages after characteristic life, 
which is attributable to the nature of biological systems to strive to survive healthier and 
longer. Empirically for ages after characteristic life, the shape parameter shows a 
quadratic expression, in which the quadratic coefficient indicates the decrease of the 
shape parameter and it tends to increase with increasing longevity. On the other hand, 
the quadratic expression is related with the mortality deceleration, plateau, and decrease, 
which could induce a mathematical limit (the mortality rate to be mathematically zero, 
implying a maximum longevity). Interestingly, the mathematical limit tends to decrease 
with increasing the quadratic coefficient. From the phenomenological explanations 
about the complementarity on longevity and the analysis of the demographic data for 
Switzerland (1876-2002), we come to the conclusion that there would be the 
complementarity between the longevity and the mathematical limit. Consequently, the 
human longevity is likely to be limited by the complementarity principle.
