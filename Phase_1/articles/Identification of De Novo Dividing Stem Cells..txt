Title: Identification of De Novo Dividing Stem Cells.
Abstract: The ability to alternate between quiescent and proliferating states is a remarkable feature of many types of somatic stem cells. The balance between quiescent and proliferating states is vital for maintenance of stem cells over the lifespan, and its disturbance may lead to premature depletion of the stem cell pool and loss of the tissue regenerative or renewal capacity at later stages of life. The question on how this balance is regulated is of critical importance in stem cell research and biology of aging. Assessment of the balance between quiescent and proliferating states has remained challenged until recently due to the lack of approaches for robust determination of the rate at which stem cells exit reversible cell cycle arrest. Here, we propose a simple method for detection of those stem cells that have entered the division cycle after a prolonged period of quiescence.The method combines cumulative and pulse labeling with thymidine analogues 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU). In the discussed labeling scheme, cells that have incorporated only the second label, EdU, are de novo dividing cells. The suggested double labeling method provides quantitative assessment of the rate at which stem cells exit the quiescent state and allows the fates of de novo dividing stem cells to be traced.
