Title: Young small extracellular vesicles rejuvenate replicative senescence by remodeling Drp1 translocation-mediated mitochondrial dynamics.
Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells have attracted interest in regenerative medicine and are being tested in many clinical trials. In vitro expansion is necessary to provide clinical-grade quantities of mesenchymal stem cells; however, it has been reported to cause replicative senescence and undefined dysfunction in mesenchymal stem cells. Quality control assessments of in vitro expansion have rarely been addressed in ongoing trials. Young small extracellular vesicles from the remnant pulp of human exfoliated deciduous teeth stem cells have demonstrated therapeutic potential for diverse diseases. However, it is still unclear whether young small extracellular vesicles can reverse senescence-related declines.
