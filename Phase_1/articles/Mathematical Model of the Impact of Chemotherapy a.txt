1 Introduction
Tumors cells are abnormal cells that are classified as either benign or malignant. Benign tumors exhibit characteristics
that do not invade normal tissues, while malignant tumors can invade and spread throughout the entire body. Glioma is
a type of aggressive brain tumor that originates from glial cells. From an epidemiological standpoint, gliomas occur
across all age groups, but they are more commonly observed in adults, with males being more susceptible than females
[1]. Solid tumors, such as gliomas in the brain, that grow larger than a critical size (1-2 mm in diameter) need to recruit
new blood vessels to supply the necessary oxygen and required nutrients for their survival and growth. This process
involves the formation of new blood vessels [2].
Blood vessels within gliomas are utilized for delivering nutrients and facilitating the migration of cancer cells. Glioma
cells migrate alongside blood vessels, displacing the interactions between glial cells and blood vessels. Through this
mechanism, glioma cells manage to extract nutrients from the bloodstream. This relocation process disrupts the function
of glial cells, compromising the proper delivery of sufficient glucose and oxygen to neurons [ 3]. These consequences
carry broader significance, impacting the well-being of neurons that rely on the support provided by glial cells for their
nourishment, structural stability [ 4], and the maintenance of the extracellular environment that envelops these neurons.
Within this intricate neural network, neurons assume a pivotal role in the processing of sensory and internal signals,
thereby making a substantial contribution to our cognitive and perceptual abilities. Malignant gliomas are characterized
by significant blood vessel enhancement due to the process of angiogenesis, which plays a crucial role in tumor growth
and colonization within the brain. The blood vessels in gliomas demonstrate the proliferation of endothelial cells,
indicating a high-grade glioma [5].arXiv:2308.11212v1  [math.DS]  22 Aug 2023Despite these advancements, a promising option for cancer treatment is chemotherapy. Currently, 9 out of 10
chemotherapy failures are linked to drug resistance. In chemotherapy, after administering specific drugs, a significant
number of patient tumor cells become resistant to those drugs. Consequently, drug resistance emerges as a serious issue
in the field of cancer. Drug resistance often imposes inevitable limitations on the long-term effectiveness of therapies
targeted at cancer patients. Significant efforts have been made to combat drug resistance and enhance patient survival.
Although the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are intricate, several paradigmatic mechanisms of drug
resistance have been established. It is widely accepted that the inherent heterogeneity within the population of cancer
cells is believed to encompass cells that are sensitive to drugs as well as cells that are resistant to drugs [6].
One of the combination therapies in chemotherapy is anti-angiogenic therapy. Anti-angiogenic therapy is a method
used to combat cancer with the aim of cutting off the supply of nutrients and oxygen to tumor cells through the
blood vessels and preventing the formation of new blood vessels. Most approved anti-angiogenic agents for cancer
treatment rely on targeting the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), as VEGF signaling is considered a primary
promoter of angiogenesis. In addition to controlling angiogenesis, these drugs can enhance immunotherapy because
VEGF also exhibits immunosuppressive functions, highlighting a potential target of anti-angiogenic therapy. Targeting
blood vessels in brain tumors has become an extremely intriguing strategy, considering the high rate of endothelial
proliferation, vascular permeability, and expression of proangiogenic growth factors [7].
The author’s interest in similar research stemmed from the realization that the process of angiogenesis can influence the
response of tumor cell growth. This insight was then applied to cases of glioma tumors with drug resistance, which
are highly malignant primary brain cancers. The model the author devised takes the form of a system of differential
equations. This model depicts the dynamics of glioma brain tumor cell growth in the presence of drug resistance.
The drug resistance, as a result of chemotherapy, renders tumor cells insensitive to chemotherapy drugs. The role of
endothelial cells in ongoing therapy, particularly anti-angiogenic therapy, becomes crucial as they play a pivotal role in
delivering supplies from anti-angiogenic agents. This has a significant impact on cancer since the required blood flow
for tumor cells can be disrupted, leading to cell dormancy. The Dormancy phase describes the state where tumor cells
cease to grow and become inactive for a certain period. As a result, the transition of tumor cells into dormancy is a
mechanism that facilitates the survival and development of tumors. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of the
proportional dynamics of resistant cells within gliomas under chemotherapy can lead to further therapeutic approaches.
This approach holds the potential for effectiveness because by cutting off the blood supply, tumor cells cannot grow or
develop. Consequently, the created model introduces additional compartments and new parameters to analyze their
influence.
This paper is organized into the following sections. In the next section, we’ll introduce our model formulation. Section 3
discusses existence and stability of the equilibria. Section 4 will present numerical simulations to back up our theoretical
findings. Finally, we’ll wrap things up in Section 5 with our conclusions and discussions.
2 Model Formulation
Previous research on glioma growth models has been conducted by [ 8] is divided into five classes: glial cells, sensitive
glioma cells, resistant glioma cells, neurons, and chemotherapy agents. Another journal introduced by [ 9] discusses
a model related to anti-angiogenic therapy for tumors in general. The author then attempts to create a combination
of anti-angiogenic therapy and chemotherapy to observe their impact on gliomas in the presence of drug resistance,
based on scientific research by [ 5]. The development performed in this study lies in the effect of subsequent therapy
that influences the glioma tumor cell compartments. The crucial impact of angiogenesis on the growth of glioma brain
tumors is referenced from the study by [ 10], thus adding parameters related to dormancy in the tumor cell compartments
as an effect of anti-angiogenic therapy. In the formulation of this mathematical model, a nonlinear system of differential
equations is defined to represent the mathematical impact of anti-angiogenic therapy and chemotherapy on glioma
tumors with drug resistance.
The cells population is separated into five parts, i.e., the glial cells ( G1), the glioma sensitive cell ( G2), the glioma
resistance cell ( G3), the endothelial cell ( G4), the neuron cell ( G5) and two agents of treatment are agent chemotherapy
(Q), and agent anti-angiogenic ( Y). The schematic interaction diagram which shows the interaction between the normal
cells, tumour cells and agent therapy has been shown on Figure 1.

In the following section, we will explore the characteristics of the solution for the model (3), encompassing its existence
and local stability of the equilibria.

3.1 The Existence of Equilibria
The equilibrium point of the glioma model, referred to as E0= (0,0,0,0,0,ϕ
φ,δ
γ), shows the nonexistence of the all
cells. This state at which the system’s variables remain constant over time.

and furthermore, to determine the value of gb

1when g2= 0andg3= 0, we obtain at least one positive root for
the quadratic equation:
p4(c4+γ)g2
4+p4((a4−1)γ−c4)g4−a4γp4+δd4= 0 (4)
by applying Descarte’s rule of signs,
gb
4=(−γa4+γ+c4) +q
(γa4−γ−c4)2−4 (γ+c4) [δ(d4)/p4−a4γ]
2 (γ+c4)(5)
for the existence of the equilibriua E1note that if δ(d4)< a 4γp4, implying −γa3+γ+c4<(γa4−γ−c4)2−
4 (γ+c4) [δ(d4)/p4−a4γ]. Next, by simple calculation we have at least one positive root for the quadratic equation:
p1(c1+ψ)g2
1+ ((a1−1)ψ−c1)p1g1−a1p1ψ+ϕd1= 0 (6)
then descarte’s rule of signs yields a quadratic Equation (6) is given by:
gb
1=(ψ+c1−ψa1) + [(−ψ−c1+ψa1)]2−4 (ψ+c1) [d1(g4, y)ϕ/p 1−ψa1]1/2
2 (ψ+c1). (7)
Therefore, if ϕ/ψ < p 1a1/(d10+d11gb
4+d12yb),gb
1>0always exists, as well as for qb.
Next, resistant glioma equilibria represent where tumor cells still persist within the host individual affected by glioma. In
other words, g2̸= 0org3̸= 0. When affected by glioma, equilibrium points in the population occur in two conditions:
first, when g2>0andg3= 0, ifg2= 0, leading to the values g2= 0andg3= 0when the equilibrium point is a free
glioma equilibrium point. Thus, we will investigate the condition where g2= 0andg3>0. Since g3̸= 0, we found
equilibrium E2= (0,0, gr

3.2 The Stability of equilibria
In this section, we’re going to investigate the stability of the equilibria by examining the eigenvalues of the Jacobian
matrices in system (3). We can determine stability by looking at whether the real parts of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian
matrix, calculated at a specific equilibrium point, are positive or negative.
For the local stability of glioma-free equilibrium point E0, E1, anda glioma resistent equilibrium point E2, we have the
following theorem.
Teorema 3.1. The first glioma-free equilibrium point, denoted as E0= (0,0,0,0,0,ϕ
φ,δ
γ), exists and is locally
asymptotically stable if the following conditions are: ϕ >p1ψa1γ
(d10+d12δ),ϕ >(p2−u−ρ)ψa2γ
(d20+d22δ),ρ > p 3,δ >p4γa4
d4. These
conditions ensure the stability of the equilibrium point E0.
Proof. To determine the stability of E0one may compute the variational matrix of system (3) about E0given by

The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of system (3) at equilibrium point E0= (0,0,0,0,0,ϕ

Furthermore, it is necessary that ϕ >p1ψa1γ
(d10+d12δ),ϕ >(p2−u−ρ)ψa2γ
(d20+d22δ),ρ > p 3, and δ >p4γa4
d4where these results are
obtained through λ1<0,λ2<0,λ3<0andλ4<0. Given that the parameters ϕ,ψ, and γare positive, we know
thatλ5,λ6, and λ7are all negative. We consider p1= 0.0068 ,p2= 0.012,p3= 0.002,p4= 0.002,ψ= 0.01813 ,
γ= 0.136,ρ= 0.01,d10= 4.7×10−8,d12= 3.9×10−8,d20= 7.8×10−2,d22= 7.5,d4= 0.71,u= 0.01, and
a1=a2=a4= 1(Table). With these values, we obtain that E0is linearly asymptotically stable for ϕ >356.22. In
other words, the chemotherapy agent kills all cells, They will never recuperate. However, the non-cell state’s stability is
only ensured at an exceptionally high infusion rate ϕ. Consequently, the equilibrium point E0is unstable.

i= 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, the equilibrium point E1is locally asymptotically stable. Therefore, the stability of the second
free equilibrium point of glioma signifies a state in which glioma cells no longer exist within the body of the glioma
patient. This indicates that chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy at specific dosages can suppress glioma growth
while ensuring that all neuronal cells are spared from any adverse effects.
In the next section we will give some numerical simulation to illustrate the theoretical results for several case.
4 Numerical Result
In this section, we will showcase several numerical simulations aimed at illustrating the theoretical findings discussed
in the preceding section. The parameter values employed in the system, as detailed in Table (1), were acquired from the
work of [8, 9].
4.1 Numerical Simulation and Biological Interpretation of the Second Glioma Free Equilibrium Points
In the case of tumor-free conditions, there are no tumor cells within the brain tissue, meaning there are no sen-
sitive glioma cells nor resistant glioma cells ( g2= 0 andg3= 0). Subsequently, a numerical simulation is
conducted based on the parameter values in Table 2 to assess the stability of the free glioma equilibrium point
E1= (0.99,0,0,0.65,0,0.18,0.0016) in the phase portrait and trajectory diagram. Therefore, in the following simula-
tion, the values of u= 0.001, α= 2andρ= 0.01are chosen. Figure 2 shows that there exists a single equilibrium
point. This equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable and has a stable node shape. When different initial values
for the concentrations of glial cells, resistant glioma cells, and endothelial cells are taken, they converge to a certain
value. The local stability analysis around this equilibrium point is provided by the Jacobian matrix below.

As a result, the eigenvalues of Df(E1)are calculated as follows: λ1=−0.001,λ2=−0.149,λ3=−0.001,
λ4=−0.009,λ5=−0.022,λ6=−0.018, andλ7=−0.007. Since the real parts of all λiare negative ( Re (λi)<0),
the equilibrium point E1= (0.99,0,0,0.65,0,0.18,0.0016) is locally asymptotically stable.
Furthermore, a trajectory diagram of cell concentrations, including glial cells, sensitive glioma cells, resistant glioma
cells, endothelial cells, and neurons, concerning initial conditions, is provided. Here, the authors depict the trajectory
diagram of equilibrium points for free glioma at t= 0−10000 .

In Figure 4, it can be observed that as time approaches infinity ( t→ ∞ ), the concentration of glial cells initially
decreases over the course of 100 days. Then, around day 101, it starts to increase until it reaches the value of g1= 0.99
or a concentration of glial cells equal to 0.99, remaining constant thereafter and approaching nearly twice its initial
value for an extended period. On the other hand, the concentration of sensitive glioma cells continually decreases
from the outset until it approaches zero over the course of 200 days, extending to infinity ( t→ ∞ ). Meanwhile, the
concentration of resistant glioma cells initially increases, almost reaching a value of 0.2on day 75, after which its
growth declines on day 76 and eventually approaches zero indefinitely.
This results in stimulation of endothelial cells. As shown in Figure 5, the concentration of endothelial cells continues to
increase every day, reaching a value of 0.65for an indefinite period. Subsequently, the concentration of neuron cells
decreases in tandem with the decline in glial cells until day 100, after which it remains nearly constant and approaches
zero indefinitely.

Therefore, the stable equilibrium point of the second free glioma represents a condition where glioma cells no longer
exist in the body of glioma patients. This indicates that chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy with specific dosages
can suppress glioma growth, with the side effect of eliminating all neuron cells as well.

4.2 Numerical Simulation and Biological Interpretation of the Equilibrium Point of Resistant Glioma
In the case of tumor resistance, tumor cells still exist within the brain tissue, meaning that resistant glioma cells persist
in the body of glioma patients. Subsequently, a numerical simulation is performed based on the parameter values in
Table 2, and parameters corresponding to the existence of the equilibrium point of resistant glioma are selected to assess
the stability of the equilibrium point of free resistant glioma E2= (0,0, gr
3, gr
4,0, qr, yr)withgr

4, qr, and yrgiven
in section (3).
To obtain an endemic case, we choose the values p3= 0.006,u= 0.01,ρ= 0.003,ϕ= 4.0×10−3,α= 2 and
δ= 2.9×10−4. In Figure 6, it can be shown that there is one equilibrium point that emerges, which is the equilibrium
point for resistant glioma, denoted as E2= (0,0, gr
3, gr
4,0, qr, yr). This equilibrium point is locally asymptotically
stable and has a spiral shape. When different initial values are chosen for the concentrations of glial cells, resistant
glioma cells, and endothelial cells, they all converge to a certain value. The local stability analysis around this
13Figure 7: Trajectory diagram of resistant glioma equilibrium points ( t= 0−10000 )
equilibrium point is provided by the Jacobian matrix below.

Subsequently, the eigenvalues were obtained as follows: λ1=−0.03996 ,λ2=−0.0181 ,λ3=−0.1554+2 .9×10−27i,
λ4=−0.0025 + 1 .98×10−25i,λ5=−0.0048−2×10−25i,λ6=−0.0024 , andλ7=−0.0046 . Since each Re(λi)
fori= 1,2,3,4,5,6,7is negative, the equilibrium point E2= (0,0, gr
3, gr
4,0, qr, yr)is locally asymptotically stable.
Furthermore, trajectory diagrams of cell concentrations, including glial cells, sensitive glioma cells, resistant glioma
cells, endothelial cells, and neurons, concerning initial conditions, are provided. In Figure 7, we shows the trajectory
diagram of the equilibrium point of resistant glioma at t= 0−10000 .
It is further clarified in Figure 8 that as t→ ∞ , the variables g1andg2approach zero. The concentration of glial cells
decreases to nearly zero over an indefinite period. Meanwhile, the concentration of sensitive glioma cells continues
to decrease initially until it approaches zero by t= 200 days and continues to zero for an indefinite time ( t→ ∞ ).
Furthermore, the concentration of resistant glioma cells increases for 1400 days and subsequently remains constant
at0.62in the indefinite time ( t→ ∞ ). This is reasonable as it falls within the capacity limits of resistant glioma cell
growth.
Figure 9 displays the trajectory diagram for variables g4andg5. The continuous increase in resistant glioma cells
stimulates angiogenesis processes in the brain, resulting in the stimulation of endothelial cell formation, leading to a
significantly higher concentration of endothelial cells, exceeding twice the concentration of resistant glioma cells, at
1.54.
Therefore, the stable equilibrium point of resistant glioma depicts the presence of resistant tumor cells that persist
within the brain tissue but does not surpass the threshold for resistant glioma cell growth ( k2= 1) while considering
specific chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic dosages.
4.3 The Behavior of Subpopulations of Sensitive Glioma Cells and Resistant Glioma Cells with Varying
Transition Rates to Dormancy Phase
Based on the graph in Figure 10 above, two cases can be considered:
•Case 1: If ρ≥p3. From Figure 10, it can be observed that the concentration of glioma cells gradually
decreases when the transition rate of cells to the dormant phase ( ρ) is greater than or equal to the proliferation
14Figure 8: Trajectory diagram of resistant glioma equilibrium points for glial cells, sensitive glioma cells, and resistant
glioma cells
Figure 9: Trajectory diagram of resistant glioma equilibrium points for endothelial cells and neurons
rate of resistant glioma cells ( p3). This implies the possibility of successful chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic
therapy. When ρ > p 3, as time tapproaches infinity, the concentration of glioma cells tends to be unstable
because the proliferation of resistant glioma cells exceeds the rate of transition to the dormant phase.
•Case 2: If ρ < p 3. From Figure 10, it can be observed that the concentration of glioma cells will increase
when the transition rate of cells to the dormant phase ( ρ) is less than the proliferation rate of resistant glioma
15Figure 10: Time evolution of g2(t) +g3(t)for various values of ρ.
cells ( p3). This implies the success of chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy in reducing the maximum
concentration of glioma cells by 1−(g4τ+1)(p3−ρ)
p3.
5 Conclusion
In conclusion, this research paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted dynamics surrounding
glioma brain tumors and their responsiveness to chemotherapy, with a particular emphasis on the crucial role of
anti-angiogenic therapy in the treatment process. The investigation commences by establishing a mathematical model
to simulate the intricate interactions taking place within the tumor microenvironment. This model incorporates
various factors, such as the diffusion of chemotherapy agents, proliferation of tumor cells, and the influence of anti-
angiogenic drugs, making it a valuable tool for assessing the efficacy of treatment strategies. One of the pivotal aspects
addressed in this study is the identification and characterization of equilibrium points within the mathematical model.
Equilibrium points represent states in which the system remains stable over time, providing critical insights into the
potential outcomes of chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy. Through rigorous analysis, it becomes apparent that
equilibrium points can vary considerably based on parameter values, specifically infusion rates and the strengths of
cellular interactions. This variation highlights the sensitivity of the system to these factors and underscores the need for
precise therapeutic planning.
Furthermore, the analysis sheds light on the attainability and stability of equilibrium points that signify tumor eradication.
Notably, it is discerned that achieving a tumor-free state often requires exceptionally high infusion rates of chemotherapy
agents. This revelation has significant implications for clinical practice, suggesting that complete tumor elimination
through chemotherapy alone may be a challenging endeavor due to potential toxicity concerns and limitations in
drug delivery systems. In this context, the study underlines the importance of considering a comprehensive treatment
approach that combines chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic therapy. Anti-angiogenic drugs, designed to inhibit the
formation of blood vessels within tumors, can complement chemotherapy by altering the tumor microenvironment,
potentially reducing the required chemotherapy dosage and minimizing side effects. This synergistic approach addresses
the issue of drug resistance often encountered in glioma treatment.
In summary, this research underscores the intricate and interdependent nature of glioma treatment. It emphasizes the
need for personalized therapeutic strategies that take into account the unique parameters of each patient’s tumor and
considers the delicate balance between chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy. By offering a deeper understanding
of the mathematical foundations governing these treatments, this study contributes valuable insights to the ongoing
efforts to improve the prognosis and quality of life for individuals facing the formidable challenge of glioma brain
tumors.
