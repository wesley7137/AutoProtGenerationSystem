Title: An in-depth understanding of the role and mechanisms of T cells in immune organ aging and age-related diseases.
Abstract: T cells play a critical and irreplaceable role in maintaining overall health. However, their functions undergo alterations as individuals age. It is of utmost importance to comprehend the specific characteristics of T-cell aging, as this knowledge is crucial for gaining deeper insights into the pathogenesis of aging-related diseases and developing effective therapeutic strategies. In this review, we have thoroughly examined the existing studies on the characteristics of immune organ aging. Furthermore, we elucidated the changes and potential mechanisms that occur in T cells during the aging process. Additionally, we have discussed the latest research advancements pertaining to T-cell aging-related diseases. These findings provide a fresh perspective for the study of T cells in the context of aging.
