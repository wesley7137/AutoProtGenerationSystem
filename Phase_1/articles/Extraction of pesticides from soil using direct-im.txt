Title: Extraction of pesticides from soil using direct-immersion SPME LC-Tips followed by GC-MS/MS: Evaluation and proof-of-concept.
Abstract: A new method was evaluated and developed for the analysis of pesticides in sandy-loam soil by direct-immersion solid phase microextraction (DI-SPME) followed by gas chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) determination. Ten pesticides were selected based on a literature survey of the compounds reported to be present in EU soils. The extraction was performed using SPME LC-Tips, a new SPME configuration with the coated fibers attached to a disposable and easy-to-handle micropipette tip, which was immersed into a soil slurry made by the addition of an aqueous solution to the soil sample. Ten experimental parameters were evaluated with a Plackett-Burman design, after which the extraction time and percentage of organic solvent in the aqueous extraction were optimized separately. The two fiber chemistries available (PDMS/DVB and C
