Title: Microbe-associated molecular patterns derived from fungi and bacteria promote IgG4 antibody production in patients with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis.
Abstract: Enhanced IgG4 antibody (Ab) response is a prominent feature of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). Innate immune responses associated with IgG4 Ab production are poorly defined. We have previously reported that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients with type 1 AIP produce large amounts of IgG4 Abs upon stimulation with bacterial cell wall components. In addition, we showed that activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells producing interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-33, and B cell-activating factor (BAFF) upon sensing intestinal bacteria mediates the development of experimental AIP. In this study, we attempted to clarify the role of innate immunity against fungi in inducing enhanced IgG4 Ab responses in type 1 AIP. PBMCs isolated from healthy controls and patients with type 1 AIP were stimulated with a broad range of bacterial and fungal cell wall components. The concentrations of IgG1, IgG4, and cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cell wall components derived from bacteria and fungi induced IgG1 and IgG4 Ab production in patients with type 1 AIP. Various types of microbe-associated molecular pattern motifs enhanced IgG4 Ab production in patients with type 1 AIP compared with the limited motifs in healthy controls. The enhanced IgG1 and IgG4 Ab production that followed in response to bacterial and fungal cell wall components was parallel to that of IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-33, and BAFF. In conclusion, cell wall components derived from fungi as well as bacteria promote IgG4 Ab responses in patients with type 1 AIP.
