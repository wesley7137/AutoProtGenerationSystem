Title: Metabolic Regulatory Network Kinetic Modeling with Multiple Isotopic
  Tracers for iPSCs
Abstract:   The rapidly expanding market for regenerative medicines and cell therapies
highlights the need to advance the understanding of cellular metabolisms and
improve the prediction of cultivation production process for human induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this paper, a metabolic kinetic model was
developed to characterize underlying mechanisms of iPSC culture process, which
can predict cell response to environmental perturbation and support process
control. This model focuses on the central carbon metabolic network, including
glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
and amino acid metabolism, which plays a crucial role to support iPSC
proliferation. Heterogeneous measures of extracellular metabolites and multiple
isotopic tracers collected under multiple conditions were used to learn
metabolic regulatory mechanisms. Systematic cross-validation confirmed the
model's performance in terms of providing reliable predictions on cellular
metabolism and culture process dynamics under various culture conditions. Thus,
the developed mechanistic kinetic model can support process control strategies
to strategically select optimal cell culture conditions at different times,
ensure cell product functionality, and facilitate large-scale manufacturing of
regenerative medicines and cell therapies.

1INTRODUCTION
Celltherapeuticsandregenerativemedicineshavethepotential
to treat and prevent diseases, such as cancers, and cardiovas-
cular and hematologic diseases1,2. The cell therapy market is
experiencing unparalleled growth and the projected worth of

To meet the rising demand, cost reductions in manufactur-
ing and increases in quality for human induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) on a large scale are crucial for the success
of cell therapies4. Unlike traditional biopharmaceuticals, thecellsaretheproductwithfunctionalidentitydependingonthe
regulatory metabolic dynamic behaviors.
The efficacy of the cells is very sensitive to culture condi-
tions. Variability in the culture conditions can lead to reduced
yieldsandheterogeneouscellpopulations.Heterogeneouscell
populations have been observed to increase the potential for
tumororteratomaformulationinthepatient5.Traditionalcell
culture process control strategies often are ad hoc and rely
solelyonexperimentalapproachesorPIDcontrollersignoring
long-term effects. The optimal design and control of mam-
maliancellcultureprocesses,especiallyiPSCs,canbelabori-
ous due to the limited understanding of cellular metabolisms
and end-to-end cultivation process dynamics6,7.arXiv:2305.00165v2  [q-bio.MN]  26 Oct 20232 WangET AL
Inordertodeterminethebestcultureconditions,accounting

needed.Mechanisticdynamicsmodelhasthecapabilitytopre-
dict cell outcomes (e.g., metabolic flux rates) and can be used
to assess product quality and strategically select the optimal
culture conditions at different times.
The proposed mechanistic model describes an iPSC
metabolic network regulatory mechanisms. It is associated
with the existing studies, including (1) metabolic flux analy-
sis (MFA)8,9, (2)13C-MFA10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, and (3) kinetic
models6,9,18,19,20. In MFA, metabolic flux rates (such as sub-
strate uptake rate and metabolite secretion rate) are estimated
based on experimental measurements subject to stoichiomet-
ric constraints. Under the standard assumption of (pseudo)
steady state for intracellular metabolites, the sum of all fluxes
producing a metabolite is equal to the sum of all fluxes con-
suming that metabolite. This technique is frequently used to
compare the metabolism of different cell lines to assess the
activityofindividualpathwaysunderdifferentcultivationcon-
ditions8.However,intracellularmetabolitescanchangeduring
cell proliferation21.
Stableisotopestudies,integratingwithMFA,haveprovided
moredetailedinformationonintracellularstateandmetabolic
pathways, namely13C-MFA can precisely estimate metabolic
reaction rates. Typically these flux rates are estimated from
measured intracellular mass isotopomer distribution (MID)
patterns and external metabolites concentrations. Common
13C and2H isotopic tracers were utilized for investigating
mammalian cell metabolism with a specific emphasis on the
interpretation of isotopic labeling patterns16. Many existing
studies are built on the assumption of isotopic and metabolic
steady state10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Several modeling tools have been
developed for situations involving isotopic and/or metabolic
non-steady states17,10,11.
Another approach to model cell dynamics includes kinetic-
metabolic models6. The vast majority of the kinetic mod-
els use Monod and Michaelis–Menten expression formalisms
modeling the metabolic regulation mechanisms18,19,20,6,9. For
Chinesehamsterovary(CHO)cellcultures,kinetic-metabolic
models include glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, respiratory chain, as well as
theregulatoryfunctionsfromenergyshuttles(ATP/ADP)and
cofactors (NADH, NAD+, NADPH, NADP+); this high level
of details is required to predict hypoxic perturbation19,20.
For example, the study9proposed a Monod model charac-
terizing the cell flux rate response to environmental pertur-
bation. That study used limiting substrate kinetics to cal-
culate the extracellular metabolite consumption/production
rates and further infer metabolic flux rates built on a static
MFA assumption, i.e., assuming the intracellular metabolitesare at the pseudo-steady state. Even though several in sil-
icometabolomic platforms have been developed for CHO
cells18,19,20,6,9, a metabolic regulatory network simulator for
iPSC has not been developed.
As lactate accumulation emerges as an inevitable outcome
of iPSC metabolism, it becomes essential to explore the con-
sequencesofaccumulatedextracellularlactateonintracellular
iPSC metabolism. Equally important is to comprehend how
glucose concentration acts as a regulatory factor, influencing
lactate production. Understanding the implications of these
concentrationvariationsisnotonlycriticalforthesurvivaland
proliferation of iPSCs22but also essential for maintaining the
qualityofcellproducts.Hence,themainobjectiveofthisstudy
is to develop and validate a mechanistic model of an iPSC
metabolic regulatory network that can precisely predict cell
responsestoenvironmentalchanges,withaparticularfocuson
variations in extracellular glucose and lactate concentrations.
The proposed model primarily focuses on central
metabolism, given its pivotal role in stem cell proliferation,
biosynthesis, and overall functionality. To estimate model
parameters, this model utilized experimentally obtained data
fromwell-designedmonolayerK3iPSCcultures,asdescribed
in the study4. During the model development, the level of
detail required for key pathways was explored, namely the
PPP and branched amino acids uptake rates into the TCA
cycle.Inthispaper,theproposedkineticmodelstructurewith
critical regulatory mechanisms will be discussed and vali-
dated through comparisons with the experimental data, with
the aim of ensuring the model’s ability to accurately predict
cell responses to environmental changes.
Theproposedmechanisticmodel,comprisingthemetabolic
reactionnetworkstructureandfluxregulatorymechanism,can
be easily customized to suit various mammalian cell culture
systems, e.g., embryonic stem cells (ESCs), CHO, etc. This
adaptability arises from the underlying principles and general
characteristicsofmetabolicregulationthatarecommonacross
various mammalian cells. Through the collection of extracel-
lular metabolite concentrations and intracellular MID mea-
surements, this mechanistic model can be adeptly employed
to analyze and forecast the behavior of other mammalian cell
cultures with consistent accuracy and reliability.

In this section, the general regulatory metabolic network
kineticmodelandtime-courseisotopiclabelingsimulationare
presented.Thekineticmodelcapturesthedynamicchangesin
celldensity,andextracellularandintracellularmetabolitecon-
centrations, where the changing rates of metabolites depend
on the concentration of substrates and inhibitors. To incorpo-
ratethemassisotopicdata,adynamicisotopiclabelingsystem
was constructed, and a time-course isotopic labeling simula-
tion was developed. Overall, the metabolic reaction network
kinetic model provides a comprehensive understanding of the
underlying mechanisms of the iPSC cultures.
(1) Metabolic Reaction Network Kinetic Model. The
data from the study for K3 iPSCs were collected during the
exponentialgrowthphase4.Throughexperimentaldesignand
statistical analysis, our previous study4discovered uniform
specific cell growth rates ( 𝜇) across the four batch culture
conditions (HGLL, HGHL, LGLL, and LGHL), maintaining
pluripotency.Thissuggeststhatglucoseandlactateconcentra-
tions within these ranges did not notably influence K3 iPSC
growth rates and did not have a detrimental impact on human4 WangET AL
K3 iPSC pluripotency. Thus the classical cell density formal-
ismwasusedtorelategrowthandthecelldensity,denotedby
𝑋(𝑡)(cells/cm2), at time𝑡as,
𝑑𝑋(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡=𝜇𝑋(𝑡). (1)
The extracellular metabolite concentrations at time 𝑡
are denoted by a vector with dimension 𝑝, i.e.,𝑠𝑠𝑠(𝑡) =(𝑠1(𝑡),𝑠2(𝑡),…,𝑠𝑝(𝑡))⊤.Similarly,theintracellularmetabolite

sion𝑞at time𝑡as𝓁𝓁𝓁(𝑡) =(𝓁1(𝑡),𝓁2(𝑡),…,𝓁𝑞(𝑡))⊤. Thus, at
anytime𝑡,thestateofextracellularandintracellularmetabolite
concentrations is denoted by
𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝑡)=(𝑠𝑠𝑠(𝑡)⊤,𝓁𝓁𝓁(𝑡)⊤)⊤.
To model the dynamic evolution of cell response to envi-
ronmental fluctuations during the iPSC cultures, at any time
𝑡, the specific reaction flux rates, represented by a vector with
dimension𝑛, depend on both extracellular and intracellular
metabolite concentrations, i.e.,
𝑣𝑣𝑣[𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝑡)]=(𝑣1[𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝑡)],𝑣2[𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝑡)],…,𝑣𝑛[𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝑡)])⊤.
Let𝑁denote a(𝑝+𝑞)×𝑛stoichiometry matrix characteriz-

dynamic evolution of extracellular and intracellular metabo-
lite concentrations is modeled through a mass balance on the
system of equations,
𝑑𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡=𝑁𝑣𝑣𝑣[𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝑡)]𝑋(𝑡). (2)
To capture the cell response to environmental perturbation,

(2)Time-CourseIsotopicLabelingSimulation. Different
13C-labeling patterns are generated by different flux distri-
butions𝑣𝑣𝑣[𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝑡)]. Thus, incorporating the dynamic system ofisotopic labeling patterns (MID), which is a vector containing
thefractionalabundanceofeachmassstateofmetabolites,into
the metabolic network kinetic model can aid in understanding
intercellular metabolic network mechanisms. However, mod-
eling each individual atom as one system state variable is
computationally expensive. To address this issue, the elemen-
tary metabolite unit (EMU) framework was proposed, and
it is based on a highly efficient decomposition method that
can identify the minimum amount of information needed to
simulate isotopic labeling24. Basically, the EMUs are created
by using a decomposition algorithm and form the new basis
for generating system equations that describe the relationship
between fluxes and isotope measurements; see more detailed
information in studies25,26,10,27,24,11,23.

3.2iPSC Metabolic Reaction Network
The developed iPSC metabolic network model leverages cen-
tral carbon metabolism from several previously published
metabolic frameworks5,3,20,8,19,4and further learns from data.
The iPSC metabolic network included glycolysis, TCA cycle,
anaplerosis, PPP, and amino acid metabolism. For simplifica-
tion, the reactions of PPP were collapsed into two reactions:
Oxidative phase/branch and Non-oxidative phase/branch (i.e.,
No. 9 & 10 reaction in Table A1 ). During the exponen-
tial phase, greater than 90% of pentose-phosphate carbons is
returned to glycolysis for the mammalian cell21,29. Thus, the
synthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids is considered as an
insignificant contributor to the model. The metabolic network

are provided in Tables A3 and A4 , respectively.
While this model primarily focuses on central carbon
metabolism,it’sworthnotingthattheadditionalmodel’sstruc-
ture, including metabolic reaction pathways (e.g., one-carbon
metabolism,fattyacidoxidation,andnucleotidebiosynthesis)
andtheassociatedfluxregulatorymechanisms,couldbeeasily

3.3Biokinetic Model of Flux Regulatory
Mechanism
Due to the lack of energetic state and redox level mea-
surements, each metabolic flux rate is modeled as depen-
dent on the substrates and inhibitors concentrations using
Michaelis–Menten model formalism. Similar to the existing
studies5,3,20, for simplification purposes and also due to a
lack of available data in the literature, a single affinity con-
stant value is used for each metabolite. Additionally, reaction
reversibility was considered during the iPSC culture model
development for some key reactions. The final model is fully
described in Table A2 . Several regulatory mechanisms (i.e.,
No.R1toR7) are highlighted in Fig. 2 , which were incor-
porated into the metabolic flux kinetics model to improve
the model’s prediction capability and better characterize the
responses to environmental variations. These key final reac-
tions are described below, where these new dependencies are
highlighted in under brackets ……⏟⏟⏟with the corresponding

The initial conditions for extracellular metabolites were
obtained from culture data. As the experimental data only
includes the relative abundance and the MIDs, estimates for
theinitialintracellularmetaboliteconcentrationsweresourced
fromtheBRENDAEnzymeDatabase37andrelatedreferences
for mammalian cells cultured under similar conditions. Sim-
ilarly, the initial kinetic parameter values were taken fromWangET AL 7
the BRENDA Enzyme Database37and relevant references for
similar metabolic networks and pathways.
The goodness-of-fit for the developed iPSC metabolic
kinetic model was assessed based on predictions using a chi-
square test. Basically, the null hypothesis is that the fitted
model can faithfully represent the iPSC culture metabolic
mechanism. This test assumes that the minimized variance-

4RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The proposed mechanistic model was developed based on a
small set of experimental data (see Section 2) and the model
predictive performance was then validated in two manners.
First, to mimic the dynamic data collection and assess the

toricaldatawereusedtofitthemodelupto 𝑡andthenthefitted

model was trained on experimental data collected over differ-
ent time intervals (0-h to 12-h, 0-h to 24-h, and 0-h to 36-h),
and used to predict the iPSC culture for up to 48-h.
Second, to assess the model’s ability to generalize and
extrapolatetonewcultureconditions,threedatasets,randomly
selected from (1) high glucose and low lactate (HGLL); (2)
high glucose and high lactate (HGHL); (3) low glucose and
low lactate (LGLL); and (4) low glucose and high lactate
(HGHL),wereusedtopredictthefourthdatasetwithdifferent

tionandevaluationstrategyisbuiltonthephilosophyofcross

sionusingtheotherthreedatasets.Therefore,byvalidatingthe
model’s prediction performance under different experimental
conditions, its robustness and usefulness for predicting iPSC
characteristics in a variety of settings is verified.
4.1Prediction of iPSC Culture Process
Duringthemodelvalidationprocess,theproposedmodelsim-
ulator was trained using experimental data collected over var-
ious time intervals (0-h to 12-h, 0-h to 24-h, and 0-h to 36-h).The model’s ability to predict the dynamic trajectories of key
metabolites, including glucose, lactate, glutamate, glutamine,
andpyruvate,aswellascelldensity,wasevaluatedbycompar-
ingthepredictedvaluestoexperimentalobservationsupto48
hours. Fig. 3 provides a representative result of the cell cul-
ture process prediction for the case starting with HGLL. The
results for the remaining settings, including HGHL, LGLL,
and LGHL, are presented in Appendix Fig. B1 to B3 .
The Chi-square test was employed to assess the goodness-
of-fit of the proposed mechanistic model trained using the
historical data collected in different time intervals. The statis-
tical test for the model trained on 0-h to 12-h of experimental
data yielded a value of 33.6 with 47 degrees of freedom ( 𝑝-
value = 0.93). Similarly, for the model trained on 0-h to
23-h and 0-h to 36-h of experimental data, the test statistics
was 82.6 with 107 degrees of freedom ( 𝑝-value = 0.96) and
138.1 with 167 degrees of freedom ( 𝑝-value = 0.95), respec-
tively. All of the p-values exceed 0.05, suggesting that the
proposed metabolic kinetics model fits well with the exper-
imental dataset. The results in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the
fitted model can provide improved predictions for most of the
metabolite trajectories as more data are collected over time.
Overall, the predicted profiles of the iPSC cultures can

though the overall growth rates were the same across the four

with time as nutrients were consumed and metabolic wastes
accumulated. It is important to note that the developed mech-

The predictions of intracellular MID from the [1,2-13C2]

which could guide the strategic feeding strategy for the inte-
grated iPSC culture process for future research. In addition,
by incorporating even the simplified PPP reactions, the M +1

equal to the flow-out flux for each metabolite.

𝑑𝑡=𝑟𝑖𝑋(𝑡),
where𝑠𝑖(𝑡)represents the concentration of the 𝑖-th metabo-
lite at time𝑡,𝑟𝑖is the specific rate of metabolite consumption
or production, and 𝑋(𝑡)stands for cell density at time 𝑡. This
equation assumes no degradation of metabolites. Notice that
ETA results are based on the assumption of metabolic steady-
state, meaning that the consumption or production rate 𝑟𝑖of
any𝑖-th metabolite remains constant and it is not influenced
by the changes in extracellular or intracellular concentrations.
Thisassumptionexplainswhymostfluxestimationsusingthe
ETA approach for 12-h to 36-h fall within the range of the
model predictions at 12-h and 36-h.
Under conditions of limited substrate availability, there
are significant changes in consumption rates, as exemplified
by glucose in LGLL and LGHL cultures, as well as pyru-
vate in all four conditions. Unlike averaging approaches (e.g.,
ETAmodel),theproposedmetabolickineticmodeleffectively
captures these essential dynamic behaviors. This capability

By modeling the regulatory mechanisms outlined
in Section 3.3, the results presented in Table 2 are
consistent with observations reported in existing stud-
ies19,18,20,30,31,32,33,34,29,35. The ability of the proposed model
to accurately predict cell dynamic behavior and response
under varying environmental conditions reaffirms its reliabil-
ity and underscores its potential to enhance the optimization
and control of iPSC culture processes. Specifically, the model
indicates that the consumption rate of glucose increases with
higher extracellular glucose concentrations (e.g., HGLL vs.
LGLL and HGHL vs. LGHL), while it decreases with higher
extracellular lactate concentrations (e.g., HGLL vs. HGHLandLGLLvs.LGHL).Thesetrendscanbeattributedtoregu-
latory mechanism R1as described in equation (7). Regarding
lactate, the model reveals that the net production rate is lower
when a certain amount of lactate exists in the cultural envi-
ronment (e.g., HGLL vs. HGHL and LGLL vs. LGHL). In
the case of pyruvate, under high lactate culture conditions,
more favorable lactate transport kinetics of MCTs result in
decreased pyruvate consumption (e.g., HGLL vs. HGHL and
LGLL vs. LGHL). These observations are associated with
regulatory mechanism R6as explained in equation (12).
Furthermore, the presence of lactate dampens the conversion
of glutamine to glutamate. Consequently, under high lactate
culture conditions, the consumption rate of glutamine and
the production rate of glutamate decrease (e.g., HGLL vs.
HGHL and LGLL vs. LGHL). These behaviors are linked
to regulatory mechanisms R2in equation (8) and R7in
equation (13).
