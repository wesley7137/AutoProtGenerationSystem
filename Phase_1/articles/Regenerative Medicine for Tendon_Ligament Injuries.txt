Title: Regenerative Medicine for Tendon/Ligament Injuries: De Novo Equine
  Tendon/Ligament Neotissue Generation and Application
Abstract:   Tendon and ligament injuries are debilitating conditions across species. Poor
regenerative capacities of these tissues limit restoration of original
functions. The first study of this dissertation evaluated the effect of
cellular administration on tendon/ligament injuries in horses using
meta-analysis. The findings led to the second study that engineered implantable
de novo tendon neotissue using equine adipose-derived multipotent stromal cells
and collagen type I. The neotendon was evaluated for its biocompatibility and
therapeutic potential in the third study using immunocompetent and
immunocompromised rat bilateral calcaneal tendon elongation model. The fourth
study investigated the therapeutic effects of neotendon in surgically-induced
non-terminal equine accessory ligament of deep digital flexor tendon injury
model.

 Abstract  
Tendon and ligament injuries are debilitating conditions across  species. Poor regenerative 
capacities of the se tissues limit restoration of original functions. The first study evaluated the effect 
of cellular administration on tendon/ligament injuries in horses using meta -analysis. The cellular 
administration was effective  in restoring ultrasonographic echogenicity and increasing vascularity 
during early phase of healing. Additionally, it improved microstructural organization of healed 
tissue in terms of cellularity and fiber alignment . However, the study did not suppo rt its use for 
increasing rate of return to performance, expression/deposition of tendon -specific genes/proteins, 
or mechanical properties .  
The findings led to the second study that engineer ed implantable de novo tendon neotissue 
using equine adipose -derived multipotent stromal cells and collagen type I . Neotendon  cultured in 
tenogenic medium using custom -designed bioreactor  contained highly proliferative tenoblast -like 
cells that matured and progressively deposited abundant extracellular matri x over 21 -day culture 
period, forming embryonic tendon -like tissue , whereas neotissue cultured in stromal medium 
contained non-proliferative sparse spherical cells  loosely attached to template throughout the 
culture period .  
The neotendon was evaluated for  its biocompatibility and therapeutic potential in the third 
study using immunocompetent and immunocompromised rat bilateral calcaneal tendon elongation 
model. Neotendon was demonstrated to be biocompatible  in immunocompetent rats , and pre-
implantation dif ferentiation was  essential to maintain phenotype , as neotissue cultured in stromal 
medium formed amorphous tissue . And the role immune cells play on aberrant tissue formation of 
non-differentiated neotissue was suggested to be critical.  v 
 The fourth study i nvestigated the therapeutic effects of neotendon in surgically -induced 
non-terminal equine accessory ligament of deep digital flexor tendon injury model. The model 
rendered minimum morbidity with impaired limb use until 9 weeks post -injury. Lesion 
recapitu lated naturally -occurring injuries ultrasonograph ically and clinically . Implanted 
neotendon led to formation of pre-mature tendon tissue that integrated with native tissue  within 
lesion , demonstrating robust healing p otential .  
Collectively, the work in this dissertation systematically analyzed  the effects  of cellular 
therapies to treat tendon/ligament injuries and identified the limitations. Following development 
of novel neotendon represents a potential breakthrough to overcome  these  limitations . Further 
evaluation of neotendon on its therapeutic efficacies is likely to contribute to improved healing of 
tendon and ligament in equine and other species.   1 
 Chapter  1. Meta -analysis of the Effects of Adult Tissue -derive d Cell Therapy 
on Tendinopathy and Ligamentopathy in the Horse 
1.1. Introduction  
 Tendinopathy and desmitis are  chronic and disabling conditions to human s that affect as 
high as 2% of the general population.1 The fraction of the affected population is even higher in 
people doing physic al work  (as much as 11% )2 or those involved with athlet ics 80% .3 In th e 
United States alone, up to 15 million musculoskeletal injuries associated with tendon and ligament 
injuries have been reported annually, and the aggregate total cost from los s of productivity and 
burden to the healthcare system can exceed nearly $ 200 bi llion annually.4-6 The treatment 
regimens  for tendon and ligament injuries  are selected based on symptoms and stages of the 
healing process, and include anti -inflammatory drugs, eccentric exercises, extracorporeal shock 
wave therapy (ESWT), as well as surgical release or reconstruction.7 Among these, the most 
common intervention for long -term therapy is eccentric exercise,8 demonst rating relative lack of 
long-term efficacy among currently available pharmacological interventions. This can be 
attributed to  the inherently low regenerative potential of tendons and ligaments. Furthermore, 
aging population s increase risk of impaired healing potentially due to reduced collagen synthesis 
as well as responsiveness to mechanical stimulus of tenocytes.9,10 As a result, although d epending 
on the type of injury and activity level s of patients , re-injury can occur in up to 18% of affected 
populations.11 
 Similarly  in equine athletes , ten dinopathy and desmitis comprise a large majority of 
musculoskeletal injuries that are responsible for up to 72% of lost training days and 14% of early 
retirements .12-14 Superficial digital flexor tendinopathy and suspensory ligament (SL) desmitis are 
the most common, comprising 46% of all limb injuries .15,16 The predominant type of tendon and 2 
 ligament injury varies among disciplines, but virtually all equine companions can be impacted. 
Strain induced injuries are common in th e equine suspensory apparatus including the SL, 
superficial digital flexor tendon ( SDFT ), and deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) .17 Many acute and 
chronic tendon and ligament lesions are thought to result from focal accumulation of microtrauma 
and poorly org anized repair tissue that can coalesce into large lesions and predispose to 
spontaneous rupture in many species .18 Treatments vary widely and can range from rest with anti -
inflammatory drugs, cold therapy and pressure bandaging to intralesional injections of various 
therapeutics and extracorporeal shock wave therapy .19 However, p oor or abnormal tissue repair 
contributes to a reinjury rate in horses as high as 67% within 2 years .20,21 Therefore , intralesional 
regenerative therapies such as platelet r ich plasma, stem cells, and genetic material have been 
applied with variable success .22 Short -term outcomes of these treatments are favorable. To date, 
there is no single, gold standard to promote healing of ligament and tendon lesions.  
 Autologous tenocyte  implantation (ATI) is one mechanism to deliver endogenous cells  to 
the site of tendon or ligament injury in adult animals and humans .23-25 Animal studies demonstrated 
ATI combined with biomaterials augment tendon regeneration by immunomodulatory effects and 
preventive effects of ectopic chondroid formation.26,27 In a human clinical prospective study, ATI 
has also been shown to alleviate pain associated with gluteal tendinopathy over 24 months period .28 
However , the therapy is limited by few harvest sites and harvest morbidity, which limits its wide 
use. Among other cell types, a dministration of exogenous adult multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) 
is more accessible and reported to augment natural healing in human tendinopathy , as well as in 
naturally -occurring and experimentally -induced equine tendon and ligament injuries .29-32 Results 
are mixed, however, in part due to differences among cell isolates, lesions, individual healing 
capacity, and low engraftment of exogenous cells (< 0.001%) .30,33 Further, there is evidence that 3 
 an inflammatory environment may impede differentiation of MSCs, and the cells may assume an 
abnormal phenotype leading to unwa nted side effects .34,35 Hence, it is of utmost importance to 
inform clinicians with a best available evidence -based guidance with respect to the effects of 
cellular therapies on tendon and ligament injuries.  
 To date, several regenerative therapies have been investigated in meta -analysis for their 
efficacy on tendinopathy. One widely utilized regenerative interventions is platelet -rich plasma 
(PRP) due to its ease of preparation and FDA approval. The application of PRP combined with 
arthroscopic rotator cuff (RC) repair was determined to be effective in reducing retear rate and 
improving several short -term pain scores.36 The effects were also evident in mid - to long -term pain 
alleviation when used as conservative treatment without surgical interventions.37 And PRP was 
effective in reducing long -term pain in ligament injury as well.38 In contrast to PRP application, 
clinical studies investigating th e effects of cellular therapies on tendinopathy and desmitis are 
limited, as are meta -analysis studies, largely because cellular therapies are still in the preclinical 
stage . Despite  this paucity , the effect of MSCs application on tendon disorder has been evaluated 
in a meta -analysis of human clinical data. According to the study, t he treatment with MSCs 
improved all the aspects analyzed : pain, functional scores, radiological parameters (magnetic 
resonance image or ultrasonography), and arthroscopic findings .32 And pain relief was cell dose -
dependent. In addition to humans and canines, equines also commonly  develop naturally -occurring 
tendinopathy. The horse has been utilized i n multiple randomized -controlled stud ies to investigate 
the efficacy of cellular therapies on tendon or ligament injuries, making horse studies an ideal 
resource for large scale meta -analysis.  Additionally,  investigations on equine tendinopathy and 
desmiti s allow extensive analysis of repaired tissue upon terminal endpoint, which is not feasible 
in human s. Collectively, systematic meta -analysis conducted on equine studies will add 4 
 tremendous value to the existing knowledge of human tendinopathy/desmitis the rapies.  
 In this study, systematic meta -analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of cellular 
therapies on treating both naturally -occurring and experimentally -induced equine tendinopathy 
and desmitis. The hypotheses tested were: 1) cellular therapies are effective in increasing long -
term rate of return to previous level of performance; 2) the effects of cellular therapies include 
microstructural improvement of repaired tissue as well as increased tenogenic/ligamentogenic 
gene express ion and protein syn thesis; yet 3) cellular therapies fail to restore original mechanical 
properties of injured tissues. Due to current regulatory restrictions on the use of pluripotent stem 
cells in clinical applications, cellular therapies included in the  study were of primary isolates of 
adult tissues, such as MSCs, tenogenically -induced MSCs, and tenocytes.  
1.2. Materials and Methods  
Literature were screened , data extracte d, and crosschecks performed in accordance with  the 
recommendations published in t he PRISMA statement.39 
1.2.1. Literature  Search   
 A comprehensive literature search was carried out with PubMed , and Web of Science  from 
January 200 1 to December 20 22. No language restrictions were applied. Key words used in the 
database included “equine” , “horse” , “tendon ”, “stem” , and “cells”.  Randomized controlled trials 
were identified using the refined search function in the databases, if available. Articles were  also 
directly search ed in veterinary journals (Veterinary Surgery, Journal of Veterinary Internal 
Medicine, American Journal of  Veterinary Research, Equine Veterinary Education, Equine 
Veterinary Journal, Journal of  Veterinary Emergency Critical Care,  and Journal  of American 
Veter inary Medical Association) using the same key words.  5 
 1.2.2. Study  Selection  Criteria   
 Studies were identified by the following inclusion criteria:  (1) a clinical study including 
randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case –control studies, or case reports and case series; 
(2) prospective studies evaluati ng the efficacy of MSCs on surgically or chemically induced lesion 
in tendon or ligament of horses ; (3) retrospective studies evaluating the efficacy of MSCs on 
naturally -occurring lesion in tendon or ligament of horses ; (4) application of undifferentiated or 
tenogenic MSCs of autologous or allogenic origin ; and ( 5) studies report ing a quantitative outcome 
of interest.  
 Exclusion criteria were the following: (1) secondary analyses of publishe d data, review 
papers  or expert opinions ; (2) individual case reports  without control cases ; (3) studies not 
report ing a quantitative outcome of interest or this information not being available after contact 
with the authors;  (4) studies with a quantitativ e outcome of interest unavailable in English ; and (5) 
application of a pluripotent stem cells including embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem 
cells. 
1.2.3. Data Collection and Extraction  
 Data collected included authors’ names, journal name, title of journal article, year of 
publication, volume, and page numbers, study design, injured limb, location of lesion, type of 
lesion, type of treatment, type of control, timing of treatment, location  of treatment, delivery of 
treatment, range or mean of age of horses , range or mean of weight of horses, breed of horses, sex 
of horses, discipline of horses, number of horses in treatment group, number of horses in control 
group, applicability of pairing limbs between control and treatment in a same horse, maximum 
follow -up period, and primary outcome measures for treatment and control groups.   
 The quantitative  outcome measure s extracted for this study w ere: (1) clinical performance 
evaluation (number of starts , palpation score, and lameness score); (2) ultrasound  (US) imaging 6 
 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation ; (3) histological score evaluation; (4) 
biochemical (gene expression and protein quanti fication) evaluation; (5) biomechanical 
evaluation ; and (6) number of horses returned to soundness . The quantitative outcome measures 
were extracted from the records directly or estimated from the graphs. When standard error of the 
mean (SEM) or interquart ile range (IR) were reported instead of standard deviation (SD), SD was 
calculated based on the sample size or IR was divided by 1.35.40  
1.2.4. Statistical Analysis  
 The results were expressed as the odds ratio (OR) for the categorical variables and as the 
weighted mean difference  (MD)  for the continuous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Weighted standardized mean differences (SMD) w ere used when  functional outcomes where 
different scales are used but with the same direction, such as scoring systems representing 
abnormal f indings with low score and normal findings with high score. Because of differences in 
type of cells used for treatment , a subgroup analysis was performed on the basis of cell types  
(ASCs, BMSCs, and tenogenic MSCs ). For each outcome analyzed, a minimum of 2 studies were 
required to interpret the result. Studies were excluded from the analysis when both groups were 
not included in the study or SD was 0.   
 Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software, which was provided by the 
Cochrane Collabo ration (https://training.cochrane.org/online -learning/core -software -cochrane -
reviews/revman/revman -5-download). A Cochran Q test was used to test for evidence of statistical 
heterogeneity. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated via I -squared statistic  and p value. 
When heterogeneity was significant (p < 0.05 or I -squared > 50%), a random effects model was 
adopted to pool the results. Then, χ2 tests were applied to identify  statistical differences of pooled 
estimates between groups, the effect measure w as the adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% 7 
 confidence intervals (CIs), and p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. The OR was 
calculated using the Mantel -Haenszel method without zero -cell corrections, SMD calculated using 
inverse variance method.  
1.2.5. Quality Assessment of the Studies  
 The following domains were assessed: (1) randomization  process, (2) deviations from 
intended interventions, (3) mi ssing outcome data, (4) outcome measurement, (5) selection of the 
reported result, and (6) overall bias. Risk -of-bias assessment was conducted by two independent 
reviewers according to Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.40 Funnel 
plot was not used to test publication bias because of the limited number (< 10 ) of studies included 
in each analysis  
1.3. Results  
1.3.1. Description of Included Studies  
 The described search strategy identified a total of 737 peer reviewed publications  and 
conference abstracts . Among those , 148 duplicates were identified and excluded. A total of 589 
records were screened by reviewing titles and abstracts and excluded according to the exclusion 
criteria. Records with no English version available (n = 148), no standard error or deviation 
repor ted (n = 2), conference papers without quantitative outcomes of interest (n = 73), review 
papers (n = 71), case reports without a control group (n = 26), non -horse clinical stud ies (n = 376), 
no treatment efficacy evaluation reported (n = 12), and treatmen t with ESCs (n = 1) were excluded

 1.3.2. Rate  of Returning to Soundness  after Injury  
 The r ate of returning to soundness  was extracted from a prospective cohort study and 5 
retrospective case series ,31,52,54 -57 which included 128 horses  in the stem cell  group and 75 in the 
control gr oup. A total of 98 (76.6%) horses treated with stem cell , whereas 28 (37.3%) horses  
treated with non -stem cell  returned to soundness  (Fig 1.2). The overall heterogeneity  across the 
subgroups  was low (I2 = 29%, p = 0.22), which suggested the use of the fixed effect model was 
appropriate . The rate of returning to soundness was higher  in the stem cell  group than in the 
control group (OR = 5.30, 95% CI [2.65 , 10.62] , p < 0.000 1). 
1.3.3. Ultrasound Evaluation of Injured Tendon and Ligament  
 The percentage of ultrasonographic lesion cross sectional area (CSA)  at the endpoint of 
the follow -up period was extracted from 3 randomized controlled trials ,41,43,50 which included 22 
horses each in both the stem cell group and the control group  (Fig 1.3) . The overall heterogeneity  
across was high (I2 = 88%, p = 0.0002 ), which suggested use of the random effect model was 
approp riate. The percentage of lesion CSA  was not different between the stem cell and control 
groups  (MD  = -6.47, 95% CI [-14.74 , 1.81] , p = 0.13).  
The echogenicity score58,59 of lesions at the endpoint of the follow -up period was 
extracted from 2 randomized controlled trials ,46,50 which included 14 horses each in both the 
stem cell group and the control group  (Fig 1.4) . The overall heterogeneity  across was low (I2 = 
0%, p = 0.83), which suggested use of the fixed effect model was appropriate . The echogenicity 
score of lesions  was lower, indicating less hyperechoic and more normal appearance, in the stem 
cell group than the control group  (SMD  = -1.94, 95% CI [-2.89, 0.98] , p < 0.0001) .  26 
  
Figure  1.2. Forest plot of the effect of stem cell treatment on the odds of return to soundness with a fixed effects model. Odds ratio 
(OR) = 1 indicates no difference between treatment and control, whereas an OR > 1 indicates that stem cell treatment is associated 
with an increased frequency of return to soundness/non -return to soundness. Confidence intervals (95% CI) that overlap an OR of 1 
suggest a lack of association between the treatment and outcome .

 The f iber alig nment score58-61 of lesion s at the endpoint of  the follow -up period was 
extracted from 3 randomized controlled trials ,30,46,50 which included 23 horses each in both the 
stem cell group and the control group  (Fig 1.5). The overall heterogeneity  across was low (I2 = 
87%, p = 0.0004 ), which suggested use of the random  effect model was appropriate . Fiber 
alignment  score of lesion s was not different between the stem cell and control groups  (SMD  = -
1.12, 95% CI [-3.12, 0.88], p = 0.27).

at the endpoint of the follow -up period was extracted from 2 randomized controlled trials  and a 
prospective cohort study , which included 23 horses each in both the stem cell group and the 
control group  (Fig 1.6). The overall heterogeneity  across was high (I2 = 84%, p = 0.002), which 
suggested use of the random effect model was appropriate . Gross transactional area of SDFT was 
not different between  the stem cell and control groups  (SMD = -1.36, 95% CI [-3.18, 0.46], p = 
0.14). 
Vascularity  of SDFT measured as power doppler score43 or color doppler density44 at the 
early phase of healing (2 week post -injury)  was extracted from 2 randomized controlled trials , 
which included 13 horses each in both the stem cell group and the control group  (Fig 1.7). The 
overall heterogeneity  across was low (I2 = 0%, p = 0.92), which suggested use of the fixed  effect 
model was appropriate . More abund ant v ascularity of the SDFT represented by the higher value 
of power doppler score and color doppler density was observed in  the stem cell group as 
compared to  the control group  (SMD  = 1.07, 95% CI [0.23, 1.92], p = 0.01).28

 Mechanical maximum stress at failure in injured tendon or ligament at the endpoint of the 
follow -up period was extracted from 2 randomized controlled trials30,47, which included a total  of 
17 horses each in both the stem cell group and the control group  (Fig 1.32) . SMD was compared  
because, although both studies reported stress using the same unit (MPa) , specimen sizes and 
specific experimental conditions differed. The overall heterogeneity across was high (I2 = 69%, p 
= 0.07), which suggested use of the random effect model was appropriate. The mechanical 
maximum stress  in injured tendon or ligament was not different between stem cell and control 
groups  (SMD = -0.01, 95% CI [ -1.26, 1.24], p = 0. 98). 55

 1.4. Discussion  
1.4.1. Main Findings  
 The findings from our meta -analysis took advantages of accumulated clinical trials using 
equine tendon/ligament injuries that recapitulate human tendon/ligament injury scenario s most 
closely while allowing extensive investigation on healed tendon/ligament under controlled 
conditions. The analysis revealed the effects of cellular therapies being beneficial in facilitating 
vascularization at earlier phase and restoring microstructu res of healed tissue. Specifically, when 
cellular therapy was used to treat both naturally -occurring and experimentally induced equine 
tendon/ligament injuries there was: 1) an increased rate of returning to performance; 2) a facilitated 
recovery of ultras onographic echogenicity and increased vascularity at earlier healing phase 
evaluated by color doppler; and 3) an improved microstructure of healed tissue by reduced 
cellularity and improved fiber alignment. Our study provides potential mechanistic insights  into 
improved healing of tendon/ligament injuries in both human and equine.  
1.4.2. Rate of Returning to Soundness after Injury  
Return  to performance after tendon/ligament injuries following cellular therapies is a major 
milestone for not only equine athl etes but  also human. Our study indicated intralesional injection 
of MSCs increase s the  rate of return  to performance in the horse. In human s, the return  to 
performance is often measured indirectly by pain evaluation using established scoring rubrics. In 
a meta -analysis of human clinical trials,  it was reported MSCs injection into commonly injured 
tendons in human s improved the overall outcome pool that includes pain, functional scores, MRI 
or ultrasonography  parameters , and arthroscopic findings  after 6 to 12 months.32 As th e cited 
study ’s outcome s include functional scores, the findings were largely comparable to our study. 
Additionally, bone marrow stimulation, an alternative method of delivery of MSCs to the site of 72 
 injury without ex vivo  processing, was evaluated for its efficacy  on treatment of RC repair in a 
meta -analysis. And it was reported that bone marrow stimulation performed during arthroscopic 
RC repair reduce d the re-tear rate  and improve d the c onstant pain score but not range of motion 
(ROM)  of the joint  or other pain scores evaluated at after 12 months post-operative ly,62 of which  
the lower re -tear rate  was in agreement  with our findings . Non-cellular injection, autologous blood 
injection , was found to improve pain scores of human patients with epicondylitis as early as 3 
months and as long as 1 year post -injection compared to corticosteroid injection in meta -analysis.63 
The rate of return to performance in horses cannot be directly compared to pain scores, 
functionality, or re -tear rate evaluated by ima ging modalities in human. However, combined 
effects from reduced pain and improved functionality may have led to the higher rate of return to 
performance in horses. One l imitation of our findings with regard to the rate of return  to 
performance is that the analysis was made from 1 PCS (prospective cohort study ) and 5 RCS 
(retrospective case series ) without RCT  (randomized controlled trial ), indicating re -evaluation 
with RCT is necessary to further validate our findings.  Moreover, many of the studies include d in 
return rate analysis were unbalanced towards the majority of subjects  assigned to cellular therapy 
groups. It is known that  unbalanced trials tend to favor interventions  of interest ,64 indicating that 
conclusion s from this particular finding need  to be carefully drawn.  
1.4.3. Ultrasound Evaluation of Injured Tendon and Ligament  
 Facilitated  ultrasonographic echogenicity recovery and increased early phase vascularity 
by MSCs that were non -differentiated o r tenogenically differentiated  suggested healing of tendon 
injuries were facilitated by cellular injection. These outcomes  have not been evaluated  in meta -
analysis  of human clinical trials , yet they were consistent with findings from several RCT s. For 
example, BMSCs improve d tendon structure as evaluated with ultrasound and MRI at 6 months  73 
 post-injection among human patients affected by chronic patellar tendinopathy .65 In human 
ultrasonographic structure evaluation is conducted often with ultrasound tissue charact erization 
(UTC) , yet it is not commonly used in equine studies.66 The only structural evaluation using 
ultrasou nd and statistically significant in the present meta -analysis was echogenicity of lesions. 
However, a previous study found a weak correlation between tendon echogenicity and stress,67 
indicating mechanical properties may not be evaluated via ultrasonographic echogenicity alone. 
Therefore, although our analysis indicated facilitated recovery of echogenicity by cellular 
therapies, it may not necessarily represent improved healing of injured  tissue. The possible 
association between tendon echogenicity and mechanical properties was suggested to be 
echogenicity change during fatigue -induced failure , as larger echogenicity change during fatigue 
loading was associated with high rate of failure us ing human cadaveric calcaneal  tendons.68 A 
useful and interesting application of  these findings  would be to investigate echogenicity of lesions 
both at weight bearing and non -weight bearing.  
 Additionally , another outcome that was improved by cellular therapi es in our meta -
analysis, improved vascularization during early phase, may have an important clinical implication, 
since neovascularization plays an essential role in tendon/ligament healing.69 In this regard, our 
findings from clinical trials were uniquely valuable in terms of mechanistic insights on M SCs’ 
effects on tendon/ligament healing. For example, neovascularization of tendon at the early healing 
phase has not been reported in human clinical study . The only available information on early 
neovascularization by MSCs are mostly pre -clinical studies.  In a recent study using a mice 
calcaneal  tendon injury model , MSCs induce d early angiogenesis of injured tendon via 
polarization of macrophages into anti -inflammatory M2 phenotype by their extracellular vesicles  
(EVs) .70 It was also confirmed  that MSCs primed to exert immunomodulatory properties increased 74 
 endothelialization and presence of M2 macrophages at injured site s, especially in the early phase 
of healing at 4 day s post-operatively  in a rat medial collateral ligament injury model .71 Therefore, 
our findings on improved vascularity of injured equine tendons by MSCs injection  may be partly 
explained by an increased M2 phenotype polarization and accumulation of M2 macrophages at the 
injury site during early healing .  
 In this study, ce llular therapies did not reduce either lesion CSA ratio or tendon CSA. In 
human s, a RCT reported BMSCs reduced ultrasonographic lesion size of chronic patellar 
tendinopathy 6 months post -injection, whereas PRP failed to reduce.65 Additionally, BMSCs had 
better UTC outcomes than PRP. On the other hand , ASCs -derived exosomes applied to the partial -
thickness RC tear of rabbits delivered by fibrin gel led to increased tendon thickness of healed 
tendon .72 Therefore, it is likely that the effect of cellular therapies are to reduce lesion size, whereas 
tendon size tends to increase.  The lack of difference in both lesion CSA and tendon CSA in our 
meta -analysis may be due to less accurate CSA measurement using ultrasonography than MRI .73 
Furthermore, relatively small lesion size often seen as core lesion in horses compared to human 
tendon/ligament lesions with  which their size  almost double the original size ,74 and small number 
of trials included in our meta -analysis  may have led to type II error . Nonetheless , the structural 
improvement was consistently found using MRI without functional and pain score improvement 
in human clinical trial of RC tear using MSCs , and may not exactly represent improved healing . 
In that study, retear rate evaluated with MRI  was 28.5% in arthroscopic treatment and 14.3% in 
ASCs treatment following arthroscopic RC tear repair, while no difference in visual analog scale 
(VAS) or range of motion (ROM) in 3 positions  was found .75 Therefore, the effects of cellular 
therapies may be more notable in imaging outcomes  than in functional outcomes . 75 
 1.4.4. Gene Expression of Injured Tendon and Ligament  
 Expression of tenogenic genes was not different between cellular therapies and controls in 
our analysis. The reason for lack of treatment effects may be that the analysis focused on the late 
phase of hea ling as opposed to an early phase.  In general, a lthough expression pattern s differ 
among genes, the tenogenic genes compared in the studies including transcription factors that 
upregulate during embryonic development or early phase of healing and gradually downregulate  
during postnatal development or late phase of healing . For example, i n healing rat tendons  from 
chemically -induced injury , Scx expression peak ed at 8 days post -injury and return ed to baseline 
by 21 days ; same trend was observed in procollagen III , LOX , Tnc. On the contrary, maturation 
marker Tnmd  continuously upregulated throughout  the 21 day post -injury monitoring period.76 In 
another study, mice received punch biopsy defect s in the patellar tendon, and it was observed Scx, 
Tnmd , and Col1a1  all upregulated gradually up to 8 weeks post -injury and downregulated to near 
baseline by 12 weeks.77 The discrepancy on the patterns of gene  expressions  is potentially 
multifactorial, including  defect type and size as well as model species. Nonetheless, it can be 
generally considered that upregulation of tenogenic genes is an early response to the injury that is 
followed by protein deposition or improvement in clinical outcomes and mechanical properties. 
The majority  of studies included in our analysis had gene expression measurement after 12 weeks 
post-injury. Therefore, it is possible the treatment effects by cellular therapies on gene expression 
receded by the time of evaluation.   
1.4.5. Compositional Analysis of Injured Tendon and Ligament  
 There was also  no difference in compositional analysis of healed tendons between cellular 
therapies and controls in the present meta -analysis. However, there was a trend of reducing DNA 
and GAG contents  by cellular therapies . In fact, the trend of lower DNA by cellular therapies was 
consistent with reduced cellularity evaluated histologically from our analysis. Since compositional 76 
 analysis normally evaluate bulk composition of both lesion and intact tissues at macros tructure 
level as opposed to histological scoring at microstructure level , it is possible  cellular therapies may 
reduce cellularity at the microstructure level yet not at the macrostructure level. Or it  may be due 
to a smaller size of core lesions as compa red to the sizes of injured tendons/ligaments. Nonetheless, 
DNA content measurement is not routinely performed in healed tendon except in horses, which 
makes outcome from the present meta -analysis unique and insightful. With regard to GAG 
contents, i t is k nown GAG deposition is a maladaptation of healing tendon. Clinically, GAG 
deposition is also debilitating, as g reater GAG content of the patellar tendon was correlated with 
greater tendon dysfunction  and pain in human s.78 Although there has not been a report on GAG 
contents from injured tendons/ligaments treated by cellular therapies in human, it was reported  
human umbilical cord -derived MSCs nearly completely prevented GAG deposition on RC defect 
created by punch biopsy  in the rat.79 The exact me chanisms of reduced GAG in injured tendon is 
yet to be elucidated, however, evidence suggests multifactorial effects. For example, i n the horse, 
decellularized SDFT scaffold from chronic tendinopathy induced seeded MSCs’ downregulation 
of tenogenic genes a nd increased release of GAG compared to scaffold from a healthy horse.80 In 
a same study, i t was also observed that cellular alignment was severely compromised on scaffold 
that has disrupted collagen fiber alignment from a horse with tendinopathy , indicating the critical 
role collagen fiber alignment plays on residing cellular phenotypes .80 Theref ore, it is possible 
improved collagen fiber alignment evaluated with histological analysis , evident from our meta -
analysis , may indirectly lead to  a trend of lower GAG deposition.  
 Similar to DNA and GAG contents , collagen and hydroxyproline contents were  not 
different between cellular therapies and controls in our analysis, although there was a trend of 
increase  amounts caused  by the treatments. Collagen and hydroxyproline contents both measure 77 
 synthesis of collagen contents directly or indirectly.81 Yet, collagen content quantification itself 
may not be a reliable measure of tendon healing , as there is discrepancy of healing responses 
among types of collagen . In particular, quantification of collagen type I and III , as well as their 
ratio, are more indicative of functionality. Structurally, intact tendons/ligaments comprise higher 
content of co llagen type I and lower collagen type III , which  leads to improved mechanical 
properties  such as modulus .82 And it was reported MSCs reduce the ratio of collagen type III over 
I when applied to rat calcaneal tendon defect along with allograft than with allograft only.83 It was 
also observed that MSCs seeded onto decellularized human flexor tendon prevented significant 
deposition of collagen type III upon subcutaneous implantation in immunocompromised rats.84 
Therefore, it is possible cellular therapies increased collagen type I synthesis while reducing type 
III deposit ion in horses, which then led to lack of difference in collagen contents among treatments. 
It may be more informative to compare the ratio of collagen type I and III among studies to draw 
a conclusion in future equine clinical trials . As an indirect quanti fication of collagen contents, 
hydroxyproline content was also reported to be an important indicator of collagen synthesis in 
healed tendon of rats , and higher contents of hydroxyproline were positively associated with higher 
failure load. In a previous st udy, MSCs were shown to increase hydroxyproline in healed tendon. 
For example, allogenic SDFT graft implanted into the SDFT defect of lambs led to higher 
hydroxyproline content when MSCs were injected simultaneously compared to no injection or 
PRP injection.85 
1.4.6. Histological Analysi s of Injured Tendon and Ligament  
 The effects of cellular therapies were more clearly demonstrated at the microstructure  level  
evaluated by histology. Our meta -analysis indicate s cellular therapies decreased cellularity and 
improved fiber alignment of heal ed tendons in horses. The decreased cellularity of healed tendon 78 
 indicated cellular therapies restored more normal structures according to the rubrics  used in the 
studies . Although there have been  no reports of decreased cellularity by cellular injection i nto 
tendon or ligament using meta -analysis, several preclinical studies demonstrated this approach is 
effective in reducing cellularity of healed tissue. For example, MSCs had a trend of reducing 
histological cellularity in healed rat calcaneal  tendon when combined with polyglycolic acid mesh 
as early as 6 days post -operatively.86 On the other hand, another commonly applied regenerative 
therapy, PRP, had increased cellularity measured as DNA contents of healed SDFT in equine 
surgical injury model after 24 weeks.61 The increased cellularity as well as GAG content was also 
observed in human calcaneal tendon after acute rupture and admini stration of PRP. At the same 
time, healed tendons had a higher deposition of collagen type I and lower collagen type III/I ratio 
as well as lower vascularization .87 Therefore , as opposed to PRP injection, our analysis indicate s 
cellular therapies are effective in obtaining more matured tendon structure in terms of cellularity.  
With regard to improved fiber alignment of healed tissue, there also has not been any report  from 
meta -analysis . Nonetheless , a study of a rat calcaneal tendon model reported contradictory findings 
of fiber alignment not being improved with application of BMSCs but , rather  by EVs.88 
Interestingly, s imilar findings from  a study of a  rat calcaneal tendon injury model indicated  
superior fiber alignment restored by  exosomes, EVs of smaller size, over ectosomes, EVs of larger 
size, at 5 weeks post-injury .89 Although not EVs, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) -2, a trophic factor 
secreted from MSCs in the form of ex osome ,90 containing hydrogel also improved collagen fib er 
orientation of primary repair of RC tear in rats as early as 4 weeks post -operatively.91 This evidence 
suggests cellular therapies improve fiber alignment of healed tendons/ligaments via paracrine 
effects.  
 While there were statistical significances in reducing microstructural cellularity and 79 
 improving fiber alignment score by cellular therapies based on our analysis, there was no effect of 
cellular therapies on tenocyte morphology score, variation in cell de nsity score, collagen type I 
distribution, vascularity, inflammatory cell infiltrate score, GAG, and total score.  Therefore, 
cellular therapies may not exert consistent effects on these microstructural properties. Yet, these 
are the outcomes often improved  by cellular therapies under controlled experimental conditions. 
For example, i t is often observed that the addition of cells to tendon healing prevents ectopic 
chondroid formation. A recent study also observed  in a tendon after injury GAG deposition is 
dramatically decreased by administration of 2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose  (2-DG) that inhibits conversion 
of glucose to glucose ‐6‐phosphate .92 MSCs are highly glycolytic cells whose growth largely relies 
on availability of glucose,93 and their ATP synthesis is virtually abolish ed by 2-DG treatment. 
Therefore, a trend of lower GAG  (standard mean difference in score: - 0.75) in MSCs -treated 
tendons in the present meta -analysis may partly be explained by deprivation of glucose  from MSCs 
uptake  at the healing site.  In fact, there was a trend of lower GAG deposition in our analysis and 
GAG contents in  our analysis, although neither  reach ed statistical significance. Interestingly , it 
was also reported MSCs -derived exosomes were effective in preventing fat infiltration into the 
healing tissue of rabbit RC upon primary repair augmented with exosome -loaded polyurethane 
patch.94 Collectively, th is evide nce suggests cellular therapies potentially prevent ectopic tissue 
formation at the sites of administration . On the other hand, total histological scores  may not have 
been different between treatments and controls because of inconsistency among varieties o f 
scoring systems . These scoring systems are often based on a few established rubrics, yet each 
scoring system is also commonly modified in each newer investigation . Notably, almost all studies 
with histological outcome measures included in our meta -analys is employed unidentical  scoring 
systems based on a few systems and modified by each investigator . This potentially increased risk 80 
 of type II error. Another potential reason for the lack of difference in total score by cellular 
therapies may be  the late timing of evaluation relative to the whole healing process. An example 
of larger treatment effects at an early phase of healing was reported in  a study  demonstrating  
human ESCs -derive d MSCs with upregulated Scx cultured on collagen/silk scaffold ; this treatment 
resulted in improved total histological scores  in non-Scx upregulated cell construct 4 weeks after 
implantation into the rat calcaneal tendon defects but not 8 weeks.95 Therefore, it is of interest to 
assess healing at an earlier phase than that commonly selected in equine tendon/ligament injury 
clinical trials.   
1.4.7. Mechanical Properties of Injured Tendon and Ligament  
 Mechanical properties compared in the present meta -analysis were also not different 
between treatment and control groups. The lack of treatment effects by cellular therapies  may be 
due to multiple factors that aff ect mechanical properties or early evaluation timing in comparison 
to lengthy remodeling process of tendon and ligament to recover full strength that can span 
multiple years .96 In general , tendinopathy or ligamentopathy increases  CSA, decreas es stiffness, 
and lower s Young’s modulus  among middle -aged individuals .97 However , a recent systematic 
meta -analysis confirmed tendinopath ic calcaneal  tendon had a lower global stiffness, lower global 
modulus and lower local modulus  than a normal  calcaneal  tendon  in humans ,98 while tendinopathy  
did not affect  the mechanical properties of  the patellar tendon, suggesting the effects of 
tendinopathy can vary depending on the anatomical location and function of each tendon that is 
affected . Other  contributor s to the mechanical properties of tendons and ligaments are an 
individual’s age  and gender. For example, age negatively affect s shear modulus of uninjured 
calcaneal  tendon  particularly among women, although the same age effect was not observed 
among men.99 Collectively, these multiple factors that variably affect mechanical properties of 81 
 tendons and ligaments may make it  difficult to detect treatment effects by cellular therapies on 
tendon/ligament healing using in vitro  uniaxial tensile testing. Partly due to this reason, in human s, 
tendon/ligament tissue elasticity is often estimated by ultrasonography  and elastography ,100 which 
may increase the sensitivity to detect treatment effects.101 Yet, there ha ve not been reports of 
cellular effects on mechanical properties in human meta -analysis.  The high sensitivity of 
elastography was also confirmed in equine SDFT,102 hence the application of this modality is 
warranted in future investigations.  
 As to an ideal timin g for evaluating mechanical properties on healed equine tendons, there 
is no consensus. And it may take even longer than multiple years for the treatment to be effective 
due to progressing tendinopathy/ligamentopathy for chronic cases. For example, human 
tendinopathy/ligamentopathy is a chronic degenerative condition from which affected individuals 
rarely recover to full function , especially among adults. However, in rodents, up to 12 weeks post -
injury recovery seems  to be a  reasonable time frame to detect improved mechanical properties by 
cellular therapies. Example s of improved mechanical properties w ere reported i n a rat calcaneal 
tendinopathy treated by exosomes89 and a rat RC tear model treated by MSCs conditioned 
media.103 Although not exosome, FGF -2, a component of MSCs -derived exosome,90 also increased 
ultimate failure load and stiff ness of rat chronic RC tear both at 6 and 12 weeks after injury.104 
Also , PRP  combined with collagen scaffold seeded with tenocyte  was shown to improve ultimate 
failure load of healed rat calcaneal  tendon compared to collagen -tenocyte construct as early as 1 
week post -operatively.105 At the same time, differences in  failure load and stiffness were much 
higher after 8 weeks than 4 weeks of post -anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and 
injection of MSCs -derived exosome than PBS or sham injection in rats .106 And similar findings 
were observed in rat RC transection and primary repair combined with FGF-2 containing gelatin 82 
 hydrogel, which resulted in  a larger difference in improvement of ultimate load to failure at 12 
weeks than 6 weeks post -operatively,91 again emphasizing the lengthy remodeling phase to clearly 
demonstrate treatment effects  on mechanical properties .  
1.4.8. Limitations  
 The outcomes evaluated in this study that were not different between cellular therapy 
interventions and control included  all gene expression levels, compositional quantities, and 
mechanical properties. All these outcomes are macrostructural analysis of healing tissue rather 
than microstructural analysis performed by histological evaluation. One possible explanation for 
the lack of cellular therapy effects at  the macro level may be due to the small lesion typically in 
the form of longitudinal core lesion within affected tendons, which inevitably leads to inclusion of 
both healing and healthy tissue in a sa me sample specimen. Another potential reason for lack of 
significance , and indeed a study limitation , is controls included in the analyses that were not 
consistent among studies compared. Often cellular therapies were compared to PBS, serum, PRP, 
conventio nal therapies, or untreated. Therefore, the outcome of this study can be interpreted as the 
efficacy of cellular therapies in comparison to the other non -cellular therapies.  Nonetheless , it is 
often common that cellular therapies fail to improve  healing of human tendon/ligament chronic 
injuries  at the functional or macrostructural level . For example, human umbilical cord blood -
derived MSCs did not improve tunnel enlargement or functional and pain scored after application 
onto reconstructed ACL of human.107  
1.5. Conclusion  
 In conclusion, our meta -analysis indicates that cellular therapies  facilitat e recovery of 
ultrasonographic echogenicity  and increased vascularity at an earlier healing phase  and improve s 
microstructure of healed tissue by reduced cellularity and improved fiber alignment  in horse 83 
 tendon/ligament injuries. However, in terms of the rate of return to performance, the efficacies of 
cellular therapies remain inconclusive due to scarcity of RCTs . Hence, o ur study supports the 
beneficial effects of cellular therapies for equine tendon/ligament injuries in improving 
microstructural organization, and provides  potential mechanistic insights into improved healing 
of tendon/ligament injuries in equine.

 Chapter  2. De Novo Tendon Neotissue from Equine Adult Stem Cells  
2.1. Introduction  
 Tendinopathy and desmitis  comprise a large majority of musculoskeletal injuries that are 
responsible for up to 72% of lost training days and 14% of early retirements by equine athletes .12-
14 Superficial digital flexor tendinopathy and suspensory ligament (SL) desmitis are the most 
common, com prising 46% of all limb injuries .15,16 The predominant type of tendon and ligament 
injury varies among disciplines, but virtually all equine companions can be impacted. Strain 
induced injuries are common in the equine suspensory apparatus including the SL, superficial 
digital flexor tendon ( SDFT), and deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) .17 Many acute and chronic 
tendon and ligament lesions are thought to result from focal accumulation of microtrauma and 
poorly organized repair tissue that can coalesce into large lesions and predispose to spontaneou s 
rupture in many species .18  
 Diagnosis is usually  made with  a combination of physical examination and ultrasound 
imaging .108 Treatments vary widely and can range from rest wit h anti -inflammatory drugs, cold 
therapy and pressure bandaging to intralesional injections of various therapeutics and 
extracorporeal shock wave therapy .19 Additionally, intralesional regenerative therapies such as 
platelet rich plasma, stem cells, and genetic material have been applied with variable success .22 
Short -term outcomes of these treatments are favorable. However, p oor or abnormal tissue repair 
contributes to a reinjury rate in horses as high as 67% within 2 years .20,21 To date, there is no single, 
gold standard to promote healing of ligament and tendon lesions.  
 There are four recognized stages of tendon and ligament healing: an acute inflammatory 
phase, a subacute reparative phase, a collagen phase, and a chronic remodeling phase. Low cell 
numbers and metabolic activity, limited blood supply, and failure of endog enous tenocytes and 85 
 ligamentocytes to migrate to the injury site affect all stages of healing and contribute to poor tissue 
healing capacity  in adult a nimal s.109,110 However, r ecent research confirms enhanced healing 
capacity of neonatal tendon over that of adults owing to migration of endogenous  tenocytes to the 
site of injury  and replac ing early fibrous scar tissue with normal tendon .111  
 Autologous tenocyte  implantation is one mechanism to deliver endogenous cells  to the site 
of tendon or ligament injury in adult animals and humans ,23-25 however the therapy is limi ted by 
few harvest sites and harvest morbidity, and it is not practical in horses. Administration of 
exogenous adult multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) is reported to augment natural healing in 
naturally -occurring and experimentally -induced equine tendon and  ligament injuries .29-31 Results 
are mixed, in part due to differences among cell isolates, lesions, individual healing capacity, and 
low engraftment of exogenous cells (< 0.001%) .30,33 Further, there is evidence  that an 
inflammatory environment may impede differentiation of MSCs, and the cells may assume an 
abnormal phenotype leading to unwanted side effects .34,35  
 The delivery of cells on scaffold matrix, often made of both natural and synthetic polymers, 
improves cellular retention at the site of implantation. Collagen is the most abundant natural 
polymer in the body and a common material for tissue  engineering  templates due to inherent 
biocompatibility .112 Collagen type I (COLI) comprises 60  – 80% of tendon and ligament structure, 
and there are numerous commercially available FDA -approved formulations .113,114 Scaffolds 
composed of COLI are routinely used for delivery and retention of stem cells in tendon and 
ligament tissue ,115 and published information confirms that COLI matrix supports differentiation 
of equine MSCs into diverse tissue lineages .112,116,117 Additionally , evidence suggests 
differentiation of MSCs into the specific lineages orthogonal to the site of injection prior to 
implantation is essential, as pre-implantation of cells into tenocytes was reported to minimize the 86 
 risk of ectopic bone and cartilage forma tion as well as tumor formation at the site of injection.118 
A recent study also reported the efficacy of pre -differentiated tenocytes’ injection into naturally -
occuring tendinopathy, as injection of tenogenically differentiated allogeneic equine MSCs into 
naturally -occurring tendon lesions resulted in a lower reinjury rate (18%) than conventional 
treatments (44%) 24 months post -treatment .119 Regardless of specific target tissue, c urrent 
knowledge supports  that MSCs that are induced to assume characteristics of native  tissue lineage 
and embedded in scaffold  matrix prior to implantation have better engraftment and promote more 
robust tissue healing than undifferentiated primary cell isolates .120 
 To further advance therapeutic capacity of pre -differentiated tenocytes, application of 
physical stimulus such as strain is known to play an essential role. Strain can be applied both 
statically and dynamically. When applied statically, elevated matrix ten sion instigates fibroblast -
to-myofibroblast activation eliciting scar -like phenotypes in vitro .121 On the other hand , tenocyte s 
maintained  under no strain for 24hr resulted in a marked upregulation of matrix degradation 
protein, m atrix metalloproteinase -1 (MMP -1) expression.122 In the same study, the importance of 
dynamic strain was demonstrated, as MMP -1 expression was completely eliminated at 3 % and 6% 
strain  with frequency of 0.017 Hz  or 1% strain with frequency of 1.0 Hz.  Several other studies also 
supported the efficacy of dynamic strain to promote tenogenic differentiation, cellular viability, 
and to regulate catabolic/anaboli c state.123-126  
 In thi s study , tendon neotissue was created by culturing  equine adipose -derived MSCs 
(ASCs ) on COLI templates  in specifically formulated tenogenic medium maintained in cu stom-
designed perfusion bioreactor both under static and dynamic strain . The hypotheses test ed were: 
1) ASCs assume a tenoblast -like morphology, express tendon -specific genes, and produce more 
organized extracellular matrix (ECM) in tenogenic versus stromal medium perfusion culture under 87 
 static strain; and 2) cell tendon -specific gene expression and ECM deposition increase with 
dynamic versus static strain in tenogenic medium perfusion culture.  The objectives were: 1) to 
evaluate  neotissue constructed by culturing  ASCs on COLI templates in stromal and tenogenic 
medium for up to 21 days under static strain for distribution and morphology of viable cells, cell 
number, tendon -specific gene expression, and micro - and ultra -structure ; and 2) to evaluate 
neotissue constr ucted by culturing  ASCs on COLI templates in tenogenic medium for 21 days 
under dynamic strain for distribution and morphology of viable cells, cell number,  and micro - and 
ultra-structure . 
2.2. Materials and Methods  
2.2.1. Study Design  
Supragluteal ASCs, p assage 2, from 8 adult horses ( 4 geldings, 4 mares) were seeded at 
1.0 x 106 cells/cm3 onto bovine COLI sponge (n  = 48), each sizing 6.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm3, and were 
then rolled into a cylinder and wrapped  with a finger trap  suture . The constructs were cultured in 
stromal (n  = 24) or tenogenic (n  = 24) medium using custom -designed perfusion bioreactors for 
7 (n = 8), 14 (n  = 8), and 21 ( n = 8) days  under 10% static strain  (Fig 2.1).  
Gross appearance of constructs was documented prior to specimen harvest  at each time 
point for molecular evaluations. Qualitative and quantitative cell growth kinetics, tendon -specific 
gene expression  of constructs were evaluated with calcein -AM/EthD -1 staining and resazurin 
reduction, and RT-PCR, respectively. Microstructure  of constructs was evaluated histologically 
with H & E  staining and  immunohistochemical staining against fibromodulin deposition. 
Ultrastructure of constructs was evaluated with  SEM and TEM .  
Additionally, the effect of dynamic strain on construct culture was evaluated. To apply 
dynamic strain, one end of each construct w as continuously displaced at 10% strain in a sine 88 
 wave at 1 Hz frequency  during culture in tenogenic medium for 21 days . Specimens were 
harvested and evaluated histological ly with H & E staining and ultrastructural ly with SEM .

template and cultured in tenogenic or stromal medium for up to 21 days  under 10% static strain .   
2.2.2. Equine Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue -derived Multipotent Stromal Cells (ASCs)  
 Equine subcutaneous adipose tissue was aseptically harvested from the supragluteal region 
of 4 adult geldings and 4 mares euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study immediately post -
mortem. Harvested adipose tissues were  minced and digested at 37  °C in 0.1% type I collagenase 
(Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) in PBS for 3 hours. ASCs w ere maintained in stromal 
medium (DMEM -Ham’s F12, 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic) until 80% confluence 
followed by cryopreservation at passage 0 (P0).  
 Cryopr eserved ASCs w ere revitalized and expanded to P1 in stromal medium prior to 
construct culture in tenogenic (DMEM -high glucose, 1% FBS, 10 ng/ml transforming growth 
factor (TGF) -β1, 50 mM L -ascorbic acid 2 -phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate, 0.5 mg/ml 
89 
 insulin, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic)  or stromal medium at P2 .  
2.2.3. Perfusion Bioreactor System  
 For each template, a COLI sponge section (Avitene ™ Ultrafoam ™ Collagen Sponge, 
Davol Inc., Warwick, RI), 6 .0 x 4 .0 x 1 .0 cm3, was rolled into a column with a d iameter of 1 .0 cm 
and length of 6 .0 cm. The column w as wrapped  by a finger trap composed of #0 polydioxanone 
suture (PDS® II, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ)  with 1 cm long loops on each end to secure the constructs 
to one immobile and one adjustable bar within a  bioreactor chamber ( Fig 2.2).  
 The bioreactor consisted of a top lid, core frame, and base chamber. The immobile 
horizontal bar is located inside the core frame and the adjustable horizontal bar is attached to the 
top lid via vertical threaded bar (Fig 2.3 – 2.5). The distance between t he bottom immobile 
horizonal bar and top adjustable horizontal bar was set at 6.6 cm to apply 10% strain on the COLI 
construct during the culture period.  
 The bioreactor chamber was connected to a perfusion system that consists of a medium 
reservoir, peri staltic pump, and medium stirrer (Fig 2.6) . The lowest port of each bioreactor was 
attached to a port of a 10 ml medium reservoir  (Synthecon, Houston, TX ) with tubing (4.8 mm 
inner diameter : Tygon®, Compagnie de Saint -Gobain, Courbevoie, France ). The reser voir had an 
oxygenator membrane at the bottom side  for gas exchange. The port o n the bioreactor cap  and the 
other port of the medium reservoir  were connected to a computer -controlled peristaltic pump  
(ISM404b, Ismatec, Wertheim, Germany ) via 3 -way stopcock s attached to 0.22 µm microfilters to 
which tubing (1.0 mm inner diameter : Compagnie de Saint -Gobain ) between the bioreactor and 
the pump was attached.

is rolled into a column with a diameter of 10 mm and length of 60 mm and surround by a finger 
trap composed of # 0 PDS® II  with 1 cm long loops on each end (A). One end of suture loop is 
tied to the immobile horizontal bar (black arrow) at the bottom of biore actor chamber (B). The 
other end is tied to an adjustable horizontal bar (black arrow) at the top of bioreactor chamber to 
apply 10% static strain to construct during culture period (C). Constructs secured to the both 
horizontal bars (D).

base chamber (#4). Immobile horizontal bar locates inside core frame and adjustable horizontal 
bar (#2) is attached to top lid via vertical threaded bar.     
 System fluid flow rate was computer controlled  (LabView™, National Instruments, Austin, 
TX) at 10 ml/minute, and the direction reversed before the medium reached one side of microfilter . 
Additional medium perfusion was rendered via stirrer (2.5 x 0.7 cm) a t 300 rpm. All bioreactor 
system parts were sterilized with ethylene oxide prior to assembly and use.  The perfusion system 
was maintained in a CO 2 incubator (5% CO 2, 37 °C) for the duration of the culture period. P2 
ASCs were  infused into COLI templates at  1.0 x 106 ASCs/cm3 template in stromal or tenogenic  
medium through the 3-way stopcocks and maintained for 21 days. Medium was exchanged every 
7 days.

Figure  2.6. Perfusion bioreactor system and cyclic tensioner.  For construct culture under static 
strain (A), a bioreactor (1) was attached to a 10 m l medium reservoir for gas exchange (2), both 
of which were connected to a computer -controlled peristaltic pump via 3 -way stopcocks  (3) 
through  0.22 µm microfilters betwe en the bioreactor and the pump. Additional medium 
perfusion was rendered via stirrer ( 4). For construct culture under dynamic strain (B), a taller 
bioreactor (5) allowed vertical motion of stirrer attached to the bottom of construct by cyclic 
tensioner (6)  externally applying magnetic field, while stirrer at the bottom of the bioreactor 
chamber was stirred. Cyclic tensioner was driven by vessel rotator.   
2.2.4. COLI Construct Specimen Harvest  
 Once each culture period was reached, the COLI construct was harvested from the 
bioreactor. Suture w as removed, construct unrolled, and full thickness cylindrical specimens were 
collected with a biopsy punch (diameter 4 .0 mm) from the top, middle and bottom regions of the 
long axis of each construct . A total of three specimens from each region w as allocated to each 
95 
 outcome . The measure  (Fig 2.7) remaining of each COLI construct sample after collecting 
cylindrical specimens for other outcom e measures was used as a single representative specimen 
combining all 3 top, middle, and bottom regions for tenogenic gene expression measurement.   
 
Figure  2.7. COLI construct specimen harvest scheme.  After each culture period, COLI construct 
was removed from the bioreactor, suture unwrapped, construct unrolled, and full -thickness 
cylindrical cut was made to obtain specimen. Three specimens were obtained from each of the 
top, middle, and bottom region of construct for each outcome measure.   
2.2.5. Qualitative and Quantitative Growth Kinetics  
 To evaluate qualitative growth kinetics of cells within constructs, s pecimens w ere stained 
with calcein acetoxymethyl (calcein -AM: Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA ) for viable cells and 
ethidium homodimer -1 (EthD -1: Thermo Fisher) for nonviable cells both at the concentrations of 
4.0 μM in PBS  at 37  °C for 30 min utes. After incubation with calcian -AM and EthD -1, specimens 
were briefly washed with PBS, placed on a glass slide  with a cover glass. The microstructural 
distribution of viable and nonviable  cells as well as cellular morphology  within entire specimen  
were  imaged  with a confocal laser microscope (TCS SP8 : Leica, Wetzlar, Germany ) at multiple 
focal planes across  the full-thickness of sample .  
 To evaluate quant itative growth kinetics of cells within a construct, t he number of viable 
cells in each specimen w as indirectly quantified using cellular metabolic activity measured by 
96 
 incubating with 10 0 μl of 50 μM resazurin reduction (Thermo Fisher) at 37  °C for 3 h ours. After 
incubation, resazurin mixture was collected, of which 50 μl was mixed with 50 μl of PBS , and 
resorufin fluorescence measured at  an excitation wavelength of 540 nm and an emission 
wavelength of 590 nm  using a microplate reader ( SPARK® Multimode  Microplate Reader: 
TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland ). Resazurin solution incubated without specimen was used as a 
negative control to subtract fluorescence from the sample values.  
2.2.6. Gene Expression - Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT -PCR)  
The remaining portion of each COLI construct sample after collecting cylindrical 
specimens for other outcome measures was used as a single representative specimen for each COLI 
construct sample combining the 3 top, middle, and bottom regi ons. Specimens w ere digested at 
37 °C in 0.1% type I collagenase  in PBS  for 1 hour, spun down  at 300 x g for 10 minutes , and 
supernatant  removed . One milliliter of TRI reagent® (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)  was added to the 
precipitate , and  homogenized by passing mixture through 18 -gauge needle 30 times . Homogenate 
was spun down at 21,000 x g for 15 minutes  at 4 °C. Total RNA was extracted from supernatant 
by phenol -chloroform extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated  RNA w as 
cleaned up by RNeasy® Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). One microgram of total RNA was 
used for cDNA synthesi s (QuantiTect® Reverse Transcription Kit, QIAGEN).  
Equine -specific primers for tendon -specific genes, scleraxis  (Scx), mohawk  (Mkx), early 
growth response 1  (Egr1 ), connective tissue growth factor  (CTGF ), lysyl oxidase  (LOX ), collagen 
1a1 (Col1a1 ), collagen 3a1  (Col3a1 ), decorin  (Dcn), elastin  (Eln), tenascin -c (Tnc), biglycan  
(Bgn) , fibromodulin  (Fbmd) , collagen 14a1  (Col14a1 ), and truncated hemoglobin 4 (THBS4)  were 
quantified  using primers previously validated127-130 or designed with Primer -BLAST ( National 
Center for Biotechnology Information , Bethesda, MD ). PCR was performed with  the denaturation 97 
 step at 9 5°C for 15 minutes,  followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94  °C for 15 seconds , 
annealing at 52 °C for 30 s econds,  and elongation at 72°C for 30 s econds using SYBR Green 
system (QuantiTect® SYBR® Green PCR Kits, QIAGEN) . Relative gene fold change was 
determined by standard means (2-ΔΔCt). Glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase  (GAPDH ) 
was used as the reference gene.   
2.2.7. Histolog ical Microstructure  
Specimens w ere fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)  overnight at 4°C , serially 
dehydrated in an increasing concentration of ethanol and xylene, paraffin embedded, and sectioned 
(5 μm) . Sections were deparaffinized  in xylene , and serially rehydrated  in decreasing 
concentrations of ethanol, followed by stain ing with haematoxyl in and eosin  (H & E). H & E 
staining was performed with incubation of sections with hematoxylin at room temperature for 3 
minutes followed by washing with deionized water and tap water. Sections were then incubated 
with eosin at room temperature for 30 sec onds, serially dehydrated with increasing concentrations 
of ethanol and xylene, then mounted with mounting medium ( Permount™ Mounting Medium : 
Thermo Fisher) and cover glass.  
Cellular morphology, distribution, and extra cellular matrix deposition w ere evalu ated after 
digital images generated with a slide scanner (NanoZoomer, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K , 
Hamamatsu City,  Japan) or a light microscope (DM4500B, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) fitted with 
a digital camera (DFC480, Leica) .

2.2.8. Immunohistochemi cal Microstructure  
The same paraffin blocks prepared for histological microstructur al analysis were sectioned 
(5 μm), deparaffinized  in xylene , and serially rehydrated  in decreasing concentrations of ethanol, 
followed by incubation in  PBST (0.1% Triton X -100 in PBS) at room temperature for 10 minutes . 
Antigen -retrieval was performed in antigen retrieval buffer (100 mM Tri s, 5% Urea, pH 9.5) at 99 
 121 °C for 30 minutes using an autoclave.  Specimens were incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA  
and 22.52 mg/ml glycine in PBST) at room temperature for 30 minutes.  
Sections were  stained with rabbit anti -human fibromodulin (PA5 -26250: Invitrogen, 
Waltham, MA) polyclonal antibody at a concentration of 1:100  in incubation buffer (1% BSA in 
PBST)  overnight at 4°C . Sections were washed with PBS at room temperature for 15 minutes each 
3 times, then stained with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor ™ 488 (A11070: 
Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at concentration of 1:200 in incubation buffer for 1  hour at room 
temperature. Following washing with PBS 3 times, n uclei were counter -stained with 4’,6-
diamidino -2-phenylindole  (DAPI: Thermo Fisher)  at a concentration of 10 μM in PBS at room 
temperature for 10 minutes . Sections were washed with PBS once and mounted with mounting 
medium (Vectashield® Antifade Mounting Medium : Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA ) and cover 
glass.  
Images were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength 
of 525 nm using  confocal microscope (TCS SP8: Leica).  Sections s tained with only secondary 
antibody w ere used as negative control, and sections of equine DDFT w ere used as positive control.  
2.2.9. Scanning Electron Microscopy  (SEM)  
Specimens were  fixed in 2% PFA and 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate  
(CAC)  buffer  (pH 7.4) for 1 h our at room temperature , and transferred to buffer (3% 
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M CAC buffer, pH 7.4) for 30 min utes. They were ri nsed with washing 
buffer (5% sucrose  in 0.1 M CAC buffer, pH 7.4), post -fixative buffer ( 1% osmium tetroxide in 
0.1 M CAC buffer, pH 7.4) , and water . Specimens  were  serially dehydrated, critical point dried, 
and sputter coated with gold. Digital images w ere created with a scanning electron microscope and 
camera at 15 kV p (Quanta 200, FEI Compa ny, Hillsboro, OR).  100 
 2.2.10. Transmission Electron Microscopy  (TEM)  
Specimens were collected from constructs cultured in stromal and tenogenic medium both 
for 21 days. Specimens w ere fixed in 2% PFA and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) at 
4 °C overn ight. They were  washed 3 times in 0.1 M PBS for 30 min each, and post -fixed in 2% 
osmium tetroxide (OsO 4) in 0.1 M PB S at 4 °C for 3 h ours. Specimens were  dehydrated in grading 
ethanol , infiltrated with propylene oxide twice for 30 min utes each, and were placed in a 70:30 
mixture of propylene oxide and resin for 1 h our, followed by polymerization in 100% resin at 
60 °C for 48 h ours.  
The polymerized resins w ere sectioned at 70 nm with a diamond knife using an 
ultramicrotome (Ultratome Leica EM UC 7: Leica), mounted on copper grids , and stained with 2% 
uranyl acetate at room temperature for 15 min utes. They w ere stained with lead stain solution at 
room temperature for 3 min utes. Images w ere obtained with a transmission electron microscope 
(JEM -1011,  JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV.  
2.2.11. Statistical Analysis  
 Results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean  (SEM) . Normality of data was 
examined with the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test. Outcome  measures w ere compared with ANOVA . 
When overall difference was detected, pairwise comparisons between groups were performed 
using Tukey’s post -hoc test.  Fold change s of tenogenic gene expression of COLI constructs 
cultured in tenogenic medium normalized to those cul tured in stromal medium for identical period s 
were compared to 1 using a one sample t -test for normally distributed results and Wilcoxon signed 
rank test for non -normally distributed results. All analyses were  conducted using Prism  (GraphPad 
Software Inc. , San Diego, CA ) with significance considered at p  < 0.05.  101 
 2.3. Results  
2.3.1. Gross Appearance  
After each culture medium and period, the COLI construct was harvested from the 
bioreactor and  its gross appearance imaged prior to the specimen collection. In stromal medium, 
constructs were initially slightly swollen  and the majority of the COLI template appeared to be 
intact without noticeable degradation at day 7 ( Fig 2.8.A). By day 14, COLI constr ucts still 
appeared to be swollen  and the area from the middle to bottom started to degrade with fibrous 
debris separating from the surface of constructs , forming rough surface . Moreover, there was a 
fissure developing in some areas of  the COLI template  (Fig 2.8.B) . By day 21, constructs 
remained swollen , and degradation further progressed especially in the bottom area. This was 
evident from discoloration and decomposition of construct around suture nots  (Fig 2.8.C).  
On the contrary in tenogenic medium, con structs started to contract by day 7 as was 
evident from space between the suture and COLI template , and the smooth surface ( Fig 2.8.D). 
The contraction of constructs further advanced by day 14, and the surface remained smooth 
throughout all construct areas ( Fig 2.8.E). Contraction of constructs were most significant at day 
21 with the majority of areas separated from the suture, and the su rface of constructs becoming 
smooth and with a continuous texture rather than  the rough and porous original COLI template 
texture ( Fig 2.8.F). Constructs were much firmer than those cultured in stromal medium or the 
original COLI template. Of note was themmore significant contraction of constructs in the top 
area. Unrolling constructs was also more difficult after 21 days of culture in tenogenic medium 
due to the strong adhesion inside constructs . Additionally, the outermost end of the COLI 
template overlap ping the inner area appeared to have merged, forming  a nearly complete 
cylindrical structure by the end of 21 day culture in tenogenic medium.   102 
  
Figure 2.8. Gross appearance of COLI constructs cultured in stromal and tenogenic medium up 
to 21 days . COLI constructs were cultured in stromal (A – C) and tenogenic (D – F) medium for 
7 (A and D), 14 (B and E), and 21 (C and F) days. Gross images were obtained after ha rvesting 
constructs from bioreactor and washing with PBS to remove coloration from medium . Coloration 
of constructs stems from each medium color. The upper area of each image corresponds to the 
top in the vertical axis of construct during culture.    
2.3.2. Qualitative Growth Kinetics  
Most cells remained viable in both stromal and tenogenic me dium  throughout the culture 
period with  the majority of cells stained with calcein -AM and a few stained with EthD -1 (Fig 
2.9). The majority of cells were spherical in stromal medium for all culture periods and in 
103 
 tenogenic medium at day 7. Cells assumed a spindle -shape and parallel alignment in tenogenic 
medium at days 14 and 21 .  
Cell numbers appeared to have been the same in s tromal  medium  throughout the culture 
period, whereas cells appeared to have prolife rated in tenogenic medium from day 7 to 14, and 
slightly decreased from day 14 to 21.  
 
Figure 2.9. Cellular morphology and distribution in COLI templates under static strai n. 
Constructs were cultured in stromal (top row) or tenogenic (bottom row) medium for 7 (left 
column), 14 (middle column), and 21 (right column) days. Viable cells were stained with 
calcein -AM (green) and non -viable cells were stained with ethidium homodim er-1 (EthD -1, red). 
Cells were spherical (orange arrows) or elongated (blue arrows). Each area indicated with arrow 
was enlarged in an inset of top right corner. Scale bars = 100 μm.   
2.3.3. Quantitative Growth Kinetics  
 There appeared to have been more cells in the bottom region of constructs regardless of 
medium type or culture period. The second most populated region of constructs appeared to be 
the top, followed by the middle. In fact, there was large disparity between  specimens heavily 
104 
 populated and those without cells. Therefore, cellular numbers from each region were combined 
to represent the entire constructs ’ cell numbers.  
Combining all 3 regions of constructs, c ell numbers did not change in stromal medium 
througho ut the culture period, while cell numbers of constructs cultured in tenogenic medium 
increased from day 7 to 14 and remained unchanged since then  (Fig 2.10). Additionally, cell 
numbers were higher in tenogenic medium compared t o those in stromal medium thr oughout the 
culture period. Of note was mitigated cellular number disparity among the specimens in 
tenogenic medium at day 21, represented by a smaller standard error.

were cultured in stromal (orange bars) or tenogenic (blue bars) medium for 7, 14, and 21 days. 
Fluorescent intensity (RFU) of reduced resorufin by viable cells were measured with microplate 
reader. Data presented as mean ± SEM.  Distinct lowercase letters indicate differences among

2.3.4. Gene Expression - Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT -PCR)  
Throughout t he culture period, all tenogenic genes tested had a trend of upregulation in 
COLI constructs cultured in tenogenic medium compared to those cultured in stromal medium.  
105 
 In particular, tenogenic transcription factors ( Fig 2.11A) appeared to have more strongly 
upregulated at day 7 and gradually returned to the baseline. Among those, Mkx downregulated 
(0.25 ± 0.05-fold) at day 14 and upregulated ( 2.28 ± 0.46-fold) at day 21 in constructs cultured in 
tenogenic medium compared  to those cultured in stromal medium.  Similarly, Egr1  upregulated 
(7.31 ± 1.71-fold) at day 7 ; CTGF  upregulated both at day 7 ( 5.48 ± 2.47-fold) and 21 ( 7.69 ± 
2.50-fold); and LOX  upregulated at day 7 ( 86.96 ± 78.50 -fold) . 
The trend of stronger upregulation at an early culture period followed by gradual 
decrease was also noted in the expressions of tenogenic ECM genes ( Fig 2.11.B). Col1a1  
upregulated at day 7 ( 2781  ± 2627 -fold). Col3a1  upregulated both at day 7 ( 29.81  ± 20.84 -fold) 
and 14 ( 26.20  ± 15.94 -fold). Eln upregulated both at day 7 ( 303.3  ± 144.4 -fold) and 14 ( 462.9  ± 
365.4 -fold).  Tnc upregulated both at day 14 (7.29 ± 2.40 -fold) and 21 (5.12 ± 1.3 5-fold).  Bgn 
upregulated at day 7 ( 8.52 ± 3.03-fold).  
For mature tendon markers, although non -significant, there appeared to be a trend of 
initial upregulation followed by further strengthene d upregulation towards the end of the culture 
period ( Fig 2.11.C). Fbmd  upregulated at day 7 ( 9.75 ± 4.68-fold).  Col14a1  upregulated at day 7 
(20.98  ± 11.05 -fold). THBS4  upregulated at day 14 ( 58.48  ± 35.51 -fold).  106

 2.3.5. Histolog ical Microstructure  
Histologically, all cells in both stromal and tenogenic medium throughout the culture 
period appeared to be viable with nucle i that had good integrity without any signs of 
fragmentation  (Fig 2.12) . Additionally, cells appeared to have homogenously stained cytosol 
without extensive vacuole formation. Similar to the findings of qualitative and quantitative 
growth kinetics, there wa s a disparity among specimens that were heavily populated by cells and 
those that had sparse cellular distribution, especially in constructs cultured in stromal medium.  
Morphologically, spherical to rhomboid cells were sparsely distributed throughout the  
constructs in stromal medium regardless of culture periods . They appeared to loosely attach to 
the collagen fibers of the template via a limited number of filopodium, or be entrapped by the 
web of collagen fibers within the template at day 7. Cell morpholog y and density were largely 
unchanged in stromal medium for the remaining culture periods. However, cells appeared to 
have increased the numbers of filopodium they project, and formed mesh -like ECM around 
themselves to attach to collagen fibers. At the same  time, there still were cells loosely attached to 
or entrapped by collagen fibers. Of note was minimum amount of ECM deposited by the cells in 
stromal medium throughout the culture periods, preserving porous structure of original COLI 
template.  
In contras t to cells in constructs cultured in stromal medium, those in tenogenic medium 
were more elongated and assumed a spindle shape by day 7. Cells tended to form clusters that 
contain numerous cells embedded in  a newly deposited fibrous ECM network. Moreover, there 
appeared to be a larger number of cells within constructs. This characteristic was further 
progressed by day 14 with larger clusters formed within constructs at higher frequency. The 
deposition of newly synthesized ECM also progressed , resulting in filling of the original COLI 
template pores with cells and ECM. The other significant change from day 7 to 14 was increased 110 
 parallel alignment among cells, many of which had elongated rod -like nucle i. By day 21 in 
tenogenic medium, most cells appeared to have extensively elongate d rod -like nuclei and 
coalesced with surrounding cells , align ing parallel to each other . The deposition of ECM also 
advanced and many areas of the COLI template had its pore filled with tissue -like structure. The 
clusters of cells also tended to form paral lel alignment along adjacent collagen fibers.

and E) or tenogenic (B, D, and F) medium for 7 (A and B), 14 (C and D), and 21 (E and F) days.

staining. Cells within constructs are indicated with yellow arrows. Representative area with cells 
in each image was enlarged in an inset of top right corner. Scale bars = 50 μm (A – C, and E) and

 2.3.6. Immunohistochemi cal Microstructure  
The deposition of tenogenic maturation marker protein fibromodulin appeared to be 
absent in constructs cultured in stromal medium both at day 7 and 14 of culture (Fig 2.13).  After 
21 days of culture in stromal medium, however, there appeared to be minimum amounts of 
fibromodulin deposition throughout the constructs.  Of note was fibromodulin distribution that 
was not consistent with cellular distribution, suggesting fibromodulin was deposited onto COLI 
template itself rather than the protein existed in the c ytosol of cells. Consistent with the other 
outcome measures, the distribution of cells represented by nucle i stained with DAPI was not 
homogeneous, and they formed several clusters within constructs.  
Similar to constructs cultured in stromal medium at day  7 and 14, those cultured in 
tenogenic medium for 7 days had no deposition of fibromodulin onto COLI template. On the 
contrary, after 14 days of culture in tenogenic medium, t here was progressively increasing 
deposition of fibromodulin onto COLI constructs . Fibromodulin deposition was  moderate and 
distributed throughout the constructs regardless of cellular distribution . Cells were non -
uniformly distributed within constructs, forming clusters represented by aggregates of nucle i. 
The deposition of fibromodulin further increased from day 14 to day 21 in tenogenic medium, 
resulting in extensive amounts of fibromodulin deposi ted throughout the constructs by day 21. 
The distribution pattern of fibromodulin appeared to be more abundant in the areas cells did not 
form clusters than those immediately adjacent to the cell clusters. And there appeared to be a 
parallelly aligned fibr ous structure of fibromodulin deposited areas in the constructs at 21 days, 
suggesting cells deposited fibromodulin directly onto collagen fibers of the COLI template. 
Interestingly, t he deposition of fibromodulin was even greater in the constructs culture d in 
tenogenic medium for 21 days than native equine DDFT tissue.   112

used for negative control ( -ve ctrl) and DDFT section was used for positive control (+ve ctrl) 
both at the bottom panels.  Green color represents fibromodulin (Fbm d) staining and blue color

 2.3.7. Scanning Electron Microscopy  (SEM)  
Ultrastructural characteristics of c ells using SEM indicated cells were spherical to 
rhomboid  within stromal medium cultured constructs throughout the culture period (Fig 2.14.A – 
C). Additionally, they deposited minimum amounts of ECM onto  the COLI template. Consistent 
with histological microstructure, cells attached to the COLI template with mesh -like ECM 
deposited around themselves ( Fig 2.14.B). On the contrary, cells were much more elongated and 
assumed  a spindle shape in tenogenic medium cultured constructs ( Fig 2.14.E and F). The 
deposition of ECM appeared to be limited until 14 days of culture in tenog enic medium , whereas 
parallel, large spindle -shaped cells were tightly adhered and surrounded by well organized, 
fibrous ECM , all attached to the COLI template in tenogenic medium at day 21 ( Fig 2.14.F ).

tenogenic (D - F) medium for 7 (A and D), 14 (B and E), and 21 (C and F) days  and images 
obtained with SEM . Cells (white arrows) were found surrounded by newly deposited ECM 
(yellow arrows) on collagen fibers of ori ginal template (blue arrows). Scale bars = 40 μm (A and 
F), 50 μm (B, C, and E), 100 μm (D).   
114 
 2.3.8. Transmission Electron Microscopy  (TEM)  
Ultrastructural characteristics imaged with TEM indicated cells were spherical and 
loosely attached to collagen fibers of the COLI template in stromal medium cultured constructs 
(Fig 2.15.A) . Cells maintained integrity of both the plasma nucleus membrane s, suggesting they 
were viable. They were rich in mitochondria and golgi apparatus -like structures. Nucleus to 
cytosol ratio was relatively high . Lack of ECM -like structures around the cells indicated cells did 
not actively deposit ECM on the existing origin al COLI template fibers.  
In tenogenic medium cultured constructs, cells assumed more elongated morphology 
represented by the elongated rod -like shape of the nucle i (Fig 2.15.B).  Nucleus membrane s 
appeared to have maintained integrity, suggesting viability of cells. The most significant 
difference of cells in tenogenic medium cultured constructs compared to those in stromal 
medium cultured constructs was the presence of a collagen fiber like struct ure present in the 
cytosol of the cells  (Fig 2.15.B . yellow arrows) . The presence of collagenous fibers within cells 
was a tenocytic characteristic.  The areas of hetero chromatin was more  abundant than in stromal 
medium , indicating transcription activity wa s relatively less active in cells from tenogenic 
medium cultured constructs.

(B) medium for 21 days and images obtained with TEM. Cells contained collagenous fibers

115 
 2.3.9. Dynamic Strain Culture  
Both qualitative and quantitative growth kinetics revealed significantly diminished 
cellularity within constructs, which resulted in a non-detectable level of cellular number by 
resazurin reduction. Microstructurally, cells were round and formed clusters  with surrounding 
granul ofilamentous ECM in tenogenic medium at day 21 ( Fig 2.16). Compared to the constructs 
cultured under static strain, cell cluster numbers were much lower , indicating interruption of 
cellular attachment to the COLI template.  Ultrastruct urally , spherical cells surrounded by 
abundant granulofi lament ous ECM formed clusters in tenogenic medium at day 21 ( Fig 2.17). 
Although cluster numbers were fewer than those cultured under static strain, cellular density 
within clusters was high and depos ition of ECM appeared to be abundant , entrapping cells 
between pillars of COLI template fibers.

 2.4. Discussion  
2.4.1. Main Findings  
The major findings of this study are: 1) equine ASCs  remained viable during  the 21 day 
culture period both in stromal and tengenic media with static strain; 2) equine ASCs  proliferated 
from day 7 to 14 in tenogenic medium, but did not prolife rate in stromal medium throughout the 
culture period with static strain; 3) equine ASCs  assumed a tenocyte -like morphology and 
organized into neotendon -like tissue on collagen templates by depositing newly synthesized 
ECM  and embedding themselves in tenoge nic medium , but remained spherical morphology and 
distributed sparsely and loosely attaching to collagen templates that contain scant ECM 
deposited by cells in stromal medium with static strain ; 4) the morphological transformation of 
collagen templates to neotendons in tenogenic medium with static strain corroborated with 
earlier upregulation of tenogenic transcription factors and later upregulation of tenogenic 
maturation markers; 5)  the maturation of neotendons during 21 day culture period in tenogenic 
medium with stati c strain coincided with progressive accumulation of tenomodulin expression on 
constructs; 6) equine ASCs  formed clusters of cells aligned parallel to collagen fibers and cells 
produced collagn fibrils around themselves  after 21 days of culture in tenogenic medium with 
static strain , all of which were ultrastructurally evident; and 7) application of dynamic strain 
during 21 day culture in tenogenic medium decreased cellular number that attached to templates, 
maintained spherical morpholog y of cells that were loosely attached to templates, and cells 
deposited fibrous ECM around themselves . Collectively, our study supports equine ASCs 
cultured on collagen templates in tenogenic medium with static strain form premature neotendon 
that recapitu late embryonic tendon development in vitro .  117 
 2.4.2. Growth Kinetics  
To date, there have been numerous attempts to culture MSCs onto collagenous scaffold 
for differentiat ion into tenocytes. And the most commonly used collageneous scaffold for this 
purpose i s hydrogel. Cells or cellular aggregates can be embedded in hydrogels  during 
solidification, after which viable cells embedded in hydrogels  and assume elongated 
morphology , especially in tenogenic medium .131,132 Although there have been reports of cells  
assum ing spindle morphology in stromal medium and maintain ing viability in collagenous  
hydrogels, often cells fail to assume tenocyte -like morphology in stromal medium. For example, 
it was reported both equine MSCs and tendon -derived MSCs retained  non-spindle morphology 
and instead assembled into cell clusters in a collagen/synthetic peptid e hydrogel in stromal 
medium culture,133 which was consistent with our constructs cultured in stromal medium . This 
evidence i ndicat es tenogenic medium culture is an essential component of neotendon 
formulation. The novel and significant advanta ge of the culture system developed in this study 
compared to existing neotendon engineering methods is the robust proliferation potential of cells 
on constructs in tenogenic medium. To date , there have been  no been report s on MSCs ’ 
maintain ing robust proliferative properties in 3D cultures,  especially on collagenous scaffolds 
regardless of medium type. Current consensus on poor proliferative properties of MSCs in 3D 
cultures was consistent only with cells cultured in stromal medium in the prese nt study. 
Additionally , robust cellular proliferation in tenogenic medium contradicted anti -prolifeative 
properties of tenogenic medium. For example, MSCs adhered to decellularized tendon 
scaffolds,134 yet cells did not proliferate during the culture period. And th ese anti-proliferative 
properties of tenogenic medium were attributed to the effects of  TGF -β.135 One of the reason s for 
robust proliferative capacity of cells in tenogenic medium observed in  our study may be highly 
expressed CTGF  gene consistently upregulated throughout the culture period. In a previous 118 
 study, mouse ASCs cultured  with CTGF not only upregulated tenognic genes but also increased 
proliferation in a dose-dependent mannar.136  
As opposed to hydrogel embedding of MSCs, culturing of MSCs onto collagen sponge 
similar to that used in this study has shown limited success. The reason for low cellular 
adheran ce and uniform distribution within sponge was reported to be the closure of p ores upon 
hydration of the sponge, which prevented migration of cells into the scaffold and exchange of 
both oxygen and nutrients inside the construct. To mitigate this disadvantage, reinforcement of 
mechanical properties of the sponge with synthetic polym er and application of a stirring culture 
method have been demonstrated to be effective.137 In particular, a stirring culture method was 
shown to increase proliferation of MSCs as well at as low as 50 rpm in poly-ethylene 
terephthalate  (PET ) reinforced coll agen sponge but not in non-PET reinforced sponge .137 This 
was consistent with our findings of non -proliferative cells in stromal medium . Our findings , 
however,  were unique  in achiev ing cellular proliferation in tenogenic medium without 
reinforement of the scaffold with synthetic polymers. The reason for highly proliferative cells 
within our neotendon might stem from high shear stress produced by a higher stirring rate 
employed in our cu lture condition. Normally, the higher stirring rate leads to more degradation 
of collagen sponge during culture, and it was demonstrated collagen sponge lost as much as 50% 
of its size and the surface of the sponge became rough  after 7 days of stirring  the culture at 150 
rpm without synthetic polymer reinforcement ,137 consistent with constructs cultured in stromal 
medium in our study.  In contrast, our neotendon cultured in tenogenic medium contracted  in size 
and its surface became  smoother  overtime , and it did not show apparent  degradation despite  
stirring  the culture at 300 rpm for 21 days. The reason for this was potentially the reinforcement 
of the collagen sponge with abundant ECM progressively deposited by tenogenically -induce d 119 
 ASCs. This was consistent with previous reports on imp roved differentiation capacity in ESCs  
by medium flow,138 and improved chondrogenesis by dynamic culture .139 Our findings are one of 
the novel applications of high shear stress to cells to promote tenogenic differentiation.  And it 
was consistent with previous report in that shear stresses induced by collagen fiber sliding during 
mechanical loading was adequate to maintain tendon mechanical properties via activation of 
mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1.140 
2.4.3. Gene Expression  
In terms of tenogenic transcription factors’ expression patterns , the expression of Scx had 
a trend of upregulation at the early culture period followed by a gradual return to the baseline. 
This was consistent with the fact that Scx is an essential transcription factor  for initiat ing 
tenogenic differentiation. Its effect in tendon healing is to direct e progenitor cells into  a 
tenogenic lineage by preventing progenitor cells from  differentiat ing into chondrogenic cells 
under the influence of TGF -β.141 Indeed, Scx depletion had a negative effect on tendon healing at 
day 28 post -injury but not at day 56 in mice .142 A similar trend was als o evident in the expression 
of Mkx with early upregulation followed by a gradual decline. Mkx is also another important 
tenogenic transcription factor, and its function was reported as preventi ng progenitor cells  from 
differentiating  into myofibroblasts at the onset of the healing process  and resulting  
angiofibrosis.143 However, in the present study, the Mkx remained upregulated in tenogenic 
medium compared to stromal medium at day 21. Therefore, it was likely that cells maintained  
certain levels of  active differentiation to tenocytes throughout the culture period. With regard to 
the expression of Egr1 , upreg ulation was statistically significant only at day 7 in the present 
study. The expression pattern corroborated that of healing tendon in a rabbit model, 
demonstrating the highest expression of Egr1  at the injury site after 7 days post -injury, followed 120 
 by decline to the original level by day 28.144 In contrast to other transcription factors evaluated in 
this study, the expression of CTGF  was significantly higher in tenogenic medium than stromal 
medium throughout the culture period consistently without clear distinction between early and 
late periods. This may be explained partly by CTGF ’s funtion as an essential molecule to prevent 
aging of tenogenic progenitors.145 It was also not ed CTGF is among the highest expressed 
constitutive tenogenic transcription  factors.146 However, CTGF  had been upregulated only at day 
3 post -injury in the chicken compared to the baseline.146 Therefore, it is possible our tenogenic 
differentiation condition recapitulate s the embryonic development of tendon tissue more closely 
than the healing process. In terms of early upregulation followed by gradual decline, LOX  had 
the most apparent trend, although the expression levels were higher in tenogenic medium 
compared to stromal medium both at 7 and 21 days of culture. LOX is an enzyme required for 
cross -linking  collagen fibils in tendons and plays an essential role in translating embryonic 
movement s into development of mechanical properties  during gestation.147 And inhibition of 
LOX during embryonic development was domonstrated to severe ly impair collagen crosslinking 
and mechanical properties of chicken tendon.148 Therefore, the higher expression of LOX  
followed by its decline suggest s the neotendon constructed in our study is again likely to 
recapitulate embryonic tendon development.  And it had been reported that application of ASCs 
to transected calcaneal tendon of rat upregulated LOX  than non -treated or ASCs combined with 
growth differen tiation factor  (GDF) - 5 at day 14 post -injury.149 In that study, the application of 
ASCs was mos t effective in restoring mechanical properties of injured tendon, suggesting the 
upregulation of LOX  is an important indicator of healed tendon functionality.  
One of the ECM producing genes, Col1a1 , a subunit of collagen type I, had an  expression 
pattern that followed  a similar trend with the transcription factors. In equine tendons, Col1a2 , 121 
 another subunit of collagen type I, expressed constitutively in both adult healthy tendons and 
acutely injured tendons, whereas expression was lowe r in tendons with chronic tendinopathy.150 
Therefore, cells cultured in tenogenic medium in this study were likely in a healthy state or 
actively healing state rather than a dormant state of chronic tendinopathy. As opposed to Col1a1 , 
the expression pattern of Col3a1  was relatively stable and upreg ulated as compared to those in 
stromal medium throughout the culture period with consistent upregulation.  Regardless of 
expression patterns, b oth genes are essential in maintaining mechanical properties of tendons. 
The expression of both genes can be aboli shed by lack of mechanical stimulus, as demonstrated 
in a study with dogs whose digital flexor tendon was unloaded by limb suspension and all 
collagen type I, II, and III expressions were severely impaired by day 42.151 At the same time, 
Col1a1  and Col3a1  were shown to upregulate in the mouse digital flexor tendon upon 
transection up to day 21 by gradual increase, yet expression of both were negligible by day 28.152 
So that  early upregulation of Col1a1  at day 7 observed in our study may be similar to the early 
response to injury.  As to  Tnc, it is normally expressed at a negligible level in tendon, and 
upregulates upon injury.153 Indeed,  Tnc is most likely  to be the essential gene for tendon 
development and healing in horses  as well . By comparing expression levels of Tnc among equine 
fetal, yearling, and adult  tendons, the  expression increased from fetal to yearling and returned to 
fetal level at adult.150 Similarly, its expression was high in acutely injured tendons, while it was 
low in healthy tendons or those affected with chronic tendinopathy.  Combined, expression 
patterns of ECM producing gen es also suggest s neotendon culture d in tenogenic medium 
recapitulate s maturing embryonic tendon or early healing tendon.  
Tenogenic maturation marker, Fbmd  was upregulated throughout the culture period in 
tenogenic medium in the present study. It is a highly and constitutively expressed gene in mature 122 
 healthy tendons. It transiently decrease s expression upon injury and gradually upregulate s over 
the healing p eriod.153 On the other hand, it ha s a monotonic increase in expression throughout 
gestation and up to 14 days postnatal lyin mice patellar tendon,154 suggesting its crucial role 
during embryonic development of tendons.  In contrast,  Col14a1  had a clearer trend of early 
strong upregulation followed by a gradual return to baseline. This was in agreement with normal 
development of the flexor digitorum longus tendon in the mouse that showed strong expression 
of Col14a1  both in gene and pr otein levels until postnatal 10 days but diminished by postnatal 30 
days.155 The functional importance of Col14a1  at an early stage  of tendon development was 
evident from the fact that k nockout of Col14a1  negatively affected mechanical strength of the 
mouse tendon at an early stage but not at a late stage. Additionally, it was repo rted that another 
tenogenic construct made of hydrogel and tenocytes showed higher expression of Col14a1  at day 
7 of culture and later downregulated by day 45. Therefore, it is likely Col14a1  is an early 
regulatory marker for neotendon maturation.156 In the present study,  THBS4  was highly 
upregulated consistently  in constructs cultured in tenogenic medium , although statistical ly 
significan t difference when compared to stromal medium was achieved only at day 7 of culture 
in tenogenic medium. THBS4  was reported to be a tendon ECM composition modifying protein, 
and knockout mice demonstrated compromized limb strength due to weakened muscle.157 In the 
ovine calcaneal tendon, THBS4  is also highly expressed in an earlier gestation period and 
gradually decrease s its expression leading to low expression in adult tendon.158 Relatively high 
expression of THBS4  in the present study suggest s again that our neotendon may more closely 
resemble developing tendons.  123 
 2.4.4. Microstructure  
Microstructures of constructs revealed progressive maturation of neotendon in tenogenic 
medium over the 21 day culture period, presented by  an increasingly elongat ed morphology of 
cells that aligned in parallel with surrounding cells and abundant ECMs deposited around the 
clusters of cells. The findings were unique in that cells appeared to have pro liferated and formed 
premature tendon -like tissue using collagen type I sponge in vitro . There ha ve been reports on 
MSCs culture d on collagen type I sponge  to treat tendon injury ,95,159,160 all of which led to 
beneficial effects of constructs to improve healing. However, microstructural evaluation 
demonstrating progressive cellular proliferation and maturation in the scaffold has not been 
reported. A report using similar methods to culture construct s made of collagen type I sponge 
with ASCs cultured in tenogenic medium demonstrated progressive deposition of ECM onto the 
scaffold without numerous cells.126 Although cells did not demonstrate robust proliferation 
within constructs, n umerous MSCs’ colonization with parallel alignment along the direction of 
mechanical stimulation evident from histological evaluation of const ruct was reported for 
hydrogel -based neotendon  that embedded MSCs .161 Similar ly, numerous cell colonies within a 
collagen -based scaffold w ere achieved by  formulating cartilagenous construct s made of human 
tendon -derived progenitor cells and cultur ing them  on collagen type II sponge cultured in 
chondrogenic medium for 21 days.162 In that study, numerous spindle -shape cells  that were 
homogenously distributed  were observed in constructs. The discrepancy between numerous 
studies using collagen type I or type II sponges reporting conflicting findings wit h regard to 
cellular proliferation when MSCs were seeded may stem from simply the  structural  difference 
between properties of collagen type I and II. For example, it was shown that higher ratio of type I 
to type II collagen in hydrogel led to lower void space in comparison to a 1:1 ratio, although a 
higher percentage of type I increased superior mechanical properties.163 Another potential reason 124 
 for the numerous cell colonies observed in the study using collagen type II sponge may be the 
additional cross -linking process of type II collagen sponge  needed  to reinforce mechanical 
properties. Collectively, our neotendon formulation protocol presents a novel method to 
construct highly cellular neotissue with organized structure  that has not been attained for 
collagen sponge -based constructs . Our findings on microstructural transformation over 21 days  
not only  demonstrate detailed morphologies of cells within neotendon, but also provide a novel 
insight on  morphological transformation during  progressive maturation of neotendon.  
The progressive increase of fibromodulin  staining in tenogenic medium -cultured 
construct s during the culture period presented possible maturation of tenoblasts at an earlier 
phase  as compared  to tenocytes at later stages. Fibromodulin is collagen -binding leucine -rich 
proteoglycan, and functions to stabilize small -diameter collagen fibril -intermediates.164 
Deficiency in fibromodulin and its same family proteoglycan lumican in mice led to m isaligned 
knee patella, severe knee dysmorphogenesis, and extreme tendon weakness , characteristic 
features of Ehlers -Danlos syndrome .165 On the other hand, enhanced expression of fibromodulin 
via liposome -based transfection or delivery of protein in the form of hydrogel led to increased 
biomechanical properties in inj ured rat calcaneal tendon and improved gait performance166,167 
indicating its essential role in the heali ng process. Therefore, implantation of constructs that 
contain abundant fibromodulin, such as those cultured in tenogenic medium in the present study, 
by itself may be therapeutic. In our study, fibromodulin  was present in a large amount at 21 days 
of cult ure in tenogenic medium after a gradual increase, while the expression of tenomodulin in 
the healthy DDFT , the positive control , was relatively low. Although fibromodulin  is generally 
considered  a maturation marker, the expression level is not monotonically increasing with age, 
and the trend varies depending on the area of the tendon. For example, its expression 125 
 monotonically increase s during gestation , reaching a peak 6 days postnatally and start declining 
at 21 days postnatally in mice tendon .168 To date, there has been no report on tenomodulin 
expression in the equine DDFT. However, our findings were  consistent with the expression 
pattern of the mouse neonate  tendon, as highly proliferative neotendon at 21 days of culture in 
tenogenic medium had a much more abundant presence of tenomodulin than healthy DDFT from 
a mature horse. Collectively, these indicate our neotendon closely resembles developing tendon 
before fully maturing , and may augument tendon healing partly by the mechanism of 
fibromoduli n delivery .  
2.4.5. Ultrastructure  
Ultrastructure of constructs further confirmed the progressive maturation of neotendon 
cultured in tenogenic medium. The celluarity was low and cells were spherical in constructs 
cultured in stromal medium. Although  collagen sponge contains both fi brous and sheet -like 
structures  that often mimic cellular morphology ,169 the presence of cells loosely attaching to 
collagen fi brils was clearly demonstrated . In tenogenic medium, however , cells assumed  a 
spindle -shape and align ed in parallel with surrounding cells , especially after 21 days of culture. 
The spindle -shape of cells was similar to that of Scx-overexpressing human ESCs -derived MSCs 
(hESC -MSCs) on silk -collagen scaffold , although cells did not obtain parallel alignment in that 
study .95 In another study using silk -collagen scaffold with cultured hESC -MSCs, highly 
elongated cells with parallel alignment in the direction of dynamic mechanical stimulation along 
with highly upregulated Scx was achieved despite them being cultured in stromal m edium,170 
demonstrating  that dynamic strain is an effective method to promote tenogenesis. In our study, 
there was parallel alignment of cells on collagen fibrils , and the number of cells found in the 
construct cultured in tenogenic medium after 21 days w as much higher and they forme d dense 126 
 cell cluster s without dynamic tensioning . It is possible the higher shear stress of fluid flow in the 
swirling motion created an optimum mechanical stimulus to orient cells in parallel alignment in 
the tenogenic medium without the use of  a dynamic tensioning apparatus . Further, TEM images  
show  the collagen fibrils within and around cells in construct s cultured in tenogenic medium , 
which was charcteristic to tenocytes .171  
2.4.6. Dynamic Strain Culture  
Cyclic tensioning applied to constructs in our study resulted in severely reduced 
cellularity. To date, it is widely accepted that cyclic tensioning improve s the viability of cells 
within the scaffold and promote s tenogenic differentiation under tenogenic conditions,126 which 
in turn results in impro ved healing of injured tendon.160 The low cellularity of construct cultured 
under cyclic tensioning may be due to lower attachment of cells to collagen fibrils evident from 
the spherical morphology of cells observed both microstructurally and ult rastructurally.  The 
reason for the lower attachment of cells to fibrils can be exceeding strain duration and length. 
For example, 2% strain for 30 minuts per day at 0.5 cycles per minute frequency was adequate to 
promote cellular proliferation and expressi on of tenogenic genes as well as ECM deposition in 
MSCs cultured on decellularized human umbilical vein using tenocytes extracts.172 Moreover, 
exceeding strain length was reported to interfere with cellular attachment when applied also 
statically. In that study , 20% static strain applied to  a collagen -based scaffold cultured with 
MSCs resulted in fewer cells compared to 0% strain, while 20% strain enhance d cell alignment 
in the direction  of strain on the scaffold with opposing gradients of mineral content and  structural 
alignment.173 The spherical morphology of cells on the collagen sponge network was similar to 
that of embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) cultured on collagen -glycosaminoglycan sponge 
ultrastructurally. Although the cell type and scaffold were different from those used in our study, 127 
 NSCs-collagen construct improved locomotion of mice affected by spinal cord injury.174 
Therefore, it is possible , despite  the lower cellularity and weak attachment to the scaffold, that 
constructs cultured under dynamic tensioning may augment healing of tendon injuries.  
2.5. Conclusion  
In conclusion, t he results of this study support de novo  tendon neotissue formation with 
adult equine ASCs on a collagen template  by culturing in tenogenic medium under high shear 
stress . Distinct differences in neotissue characteristics with static versus dynamic strain confirms 
the value of the in vitro  study  environment to evaluate neotendon formation to guide therapeutic 
interventions. In the future, implantation of proliferation phase neotissue may promote tendon 
healing  in equine s and beyond .

 Chapter  3. Healing Capacity of Implantable Collagen Constructs for Equine 
Tendon Regeneration in an Elongation -induced Rat calcaneal  Tendinopathy 
Model  
3.1. Introduction  
 Musculoskeletal injury is responsible for up to 72% of lost training days and 14% of 
retirements by equine athletes ,12,14 and tendon injuries account for the large majority. Recovery 
from tendon injuries is prolonged due to a slow healing response attributable to low tendo n tissue 
cellularity, metabolic activity and blood supply109 that contribute to permanent scar formation and 
high re -injury rates .21,110 Research shows that neonatal tendon heals without scar tissue by a 
mechanism recently identified in a murine mod el.111 Specifically, following tendon injury in 
neonates, a transient fibrous patch (or scar) is formed by extrinsic fibroblasts. Sub sequently, 
tenocytes migrate to and replace the fibrous tissue with neotendon. In adults, tenocytes in 
undamaged tissue are activated but don’t migrate to the injury, so persisting fibroblasts form a 
permanent scar .111  
 To overcome this recognized challenge, adult multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) have been 
directly injected into naturally -occurring and experimentally -induced tendon injuries with mixed 
and unpredictable results .175 The variability has been attributed to an engraftment efficiency of less 
than 0.001% .175 Additionally, injection of undifferentiated MSCs into tendon can have serious side 
effects including chondroid an d ectopic bone formation at the injection site .34 To improve retention 
and engraftment, c ollagen type I ( COLI ), an FDA -approved, biocompatible , and biodegradable 
biomaterial ,114 has been used as  template material for MSCs to grow in cardiac neotissue 
formation .176 It serve s as a cellular delivery/retention platform that is compatible with injectable 
therapies.  Additionally, tenogenically differentiated adipose -derived MSCs ( ASCs ) obviate 
abnormal tissue formation from administration of undifferentiated MSCs.  By combining the se 129 
 strategies, w e have successfully generated tendon  neotissue from ASCs  that are tenogenically 
differentiated and grown on COLI scaffold templates to circumvent these limitations . 
 Neotissue generated by MSCs only or combined with  COLI templates require s testing in 
an appropriate rodent tendinopathy model prior to preclinical equine testing. To date, the treatment 
effects of tendon neotissue  has been  most commonly investigated  in rodent acute tendon injury 
models created by surgical resection of portion of  tendon. They were treated with MSCs alone ,177 
COLI scaffolds populated with MSCs ,126 and tendon stem/progenitor cell (TSC) sheets ,178 all of  
which resulted in improved mechanical strength and histological scores. However, caution needs 
to be taken with interpretation of these outcomes, since rodents possess stronger tendon 
regenerative potential179 and surgically created tendon defect models does not simulate clinical 
scenario characterized by chronic tendinopathy and subsequent rupture . Moreover, surgical 
implantation of neotissue at the time of injury is not a feasible  approach for clinical application. 
More realistically , the optimum time t o deliver exogenous cells to an injured tendon or ligament 
in horses is around the sixth day after injury at the transition between the inflammatory and 
subacute reparative phases .180 
 In this regard, tendinopathy models  that resemble clinical tendinopathy  scenario  both 
etiologically and patho logically , as well as  administration strategies that are clinically feasible  are 
essential to test efficacy and therapeutic value of novel treatment modalities. One of the most 
commonly used tendon for tendinopathy mod el creation is rat calcaneal tendon composed of 
insertions of the plantaris, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles  due to its  access ibility  for controlled 
injury and subsequent treatment administration.181 The type s of tendinopathy creation mechanisms 
range from chemical injury induction with collagenase, cytokines, prostaglandins and 
fluoroquinolone, or mechanical injury induction with electrical muscle stimulation and 130 
 downhill/uphill running  have been used across multiple animal species.182 Among these, 
downhill/uphill running can most closely recapitulate the overuse nature of tendinopathy which 
account for majority of naturally -occurring tendon injuries in equine athletes. And rats underwent 
strenuous uphill treadmill running for 12 weeks were shown to have developed tendinopathy 
resembling naturally occurring human tendinopathy characterized by  decreased collagen fiber 
organization, increased cellularity with endothelial cells and fibroblasts, wh ile causing m inimum 
inflammatory response .183  
 However, strain injuries induced by these methods often can be inconsisten t and subject to 
inherent individual variation. It is believed that mechanism of overuse tendinopathy  is excessive 
loading and tensile strain beyond 4% of its length  where  the collagen fibers start to slide past one 
another as the intermolecular cross -links fail, and, at approximately 8% of elongation, a 
macroscopic rupture occurs because of tensile failure of the fibers and interfibrillar shear failure .184 
Indeed , the elongation of superficial digital flexor tendon ( SDFT ) is a sign of tendinopathy 
presented as  medial or lateral displacement ,185 or sometimes as bowed tendon  in horses .186 As 
such, surgical elongation of tendon using a tool devised to create  strain injuries in canine 
ligaments187 is an appealing tendinopathy model creation modality, as it can consistently control 
strain level  to minimize variations while simulating etiology of naturally -occurring tendinopathy .  
 Another important consideration in animal tendinopathy model creation is the role immune 
system plays in tendon healing.188 This is especially important, because varieties in expression 
level and haplotype of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II within horse population had 
been reported to elicit immune responses  despite of MSCs ’ general status  as hypoimmunogenic  to 
non-immunogenic  from  lack of MHC II expression .189 Moreover, haplotype -mismatched allogenic 
MSCs are known to be short -lived in vivo  upon transplantation, which contributes to failure of 131 
 implants .190 Combining difficulties in identifying MHC II haplotype -matched donors among 50 
known haplotype s191 and superior accessibility of allogenic versus autologo us MSCs in horses, it 
is important to develop neotissue from allogenic MSCs that does not elicit immune response and 
augment healing in immnocompetent recipient individuals . Therefore, the use of  both 
immunocompromised and immunocompetent rats to create te ndinopathy model can elucidate the 
role immune system play in tendon healing by neotissue and leads to development of readily 
accessible immunocompatible neotissue .  
 In this study, tendon neotissue created from equine ASCs cultured on COLI template in 
tenogenic or stromal medium for 21 days under static strain, or phosphate buffered saline  as no 
treatment were implanted via needle in randomly selected limb of each rat 6 days after bilateral 
elongation -induced calcaneal tendon injury creation . Hypotheses tested were : 1) tenogenic 
neotissue implanted is immunocompatible and regenerative without eliciting immune response and 
form tendon -like tissue, while stromal neotissue implant is immunocompatible yet non -
regenerative without forming tendon -like tissue ; and 2) the immune system plays an role in a 
mechanism of non -regenerative tissue formation by stromal neotissue. The objectives of the study 
were: 1) to compare microstructure of implanted both tenogenic and stromal neotissue s in 
immuno competent rat calcaneal tendon; and 2) to compare microstructure of implanted stromal 
neotissues in both immunocompetent and immnocompromised rat calcaneal tendon.   
3.2. Materials and Methods  
3.2.1. Study Design   
 Protocol s (#21-022 and #21 -051) were approved by the Louisiana State University 
Institutional Animal Care and Use committee prior to study initiation . calcaneal  tendon elongation 
injury was made bilaterally to both hindlimbs of each Sprague Dawley  (SD) rat (n = 18) and RNU 132 
 Nude (RNU) rat (n = 12). Bovine corium COLI (Avitene ™ Ultrafoam ™ Collagen Sponge, Davol 
Inc., Warwick, RI) templates were infused with e quine ASCs from 1 adult gelding, and cultured 
in tenogenic (n = 30) or stromal (n = 15) medium  for 21 days.  
 Six days after calcaneal ten don elongation injury, t enogenic neotissue (SD rat: n = 18; RNU 
rat: n = 12) was percutaneously injected into tendon lesion of one randomly selected hindlimb  in 
each rat via needle. The opposite tendon lesion in each animal w as injected with stromal neotis sue 
(SD rat: n = 9; RNU rat: n = 5 ) or PBS ( SD rat: n = 9; RNU rat: n = 5 ). Limb use was  evaluated 
with an established rubric for all rats 1 week before surgery, daily up to 14 days after surgery and 
then weekly until harvest 6 weeks after surgery.  
 Tendons from 15 rats ( SD rat: n = 9; RNU rat: n = 5 ) were evaluated for tensile mechanical 
properties. Tendons from the other 15 rats (SD rat: n = 9; RNU rat: n = 5) were  divided sagitally 
to give four quadrants, medial axial, medial abaxial, lateral axial , and lateral abaxial . One quadrant 
from each rat w as assigned to one of four outcome measures, gene expression, collagen 
composition, and micro - and ultrastructure ( Fig 4.1, 4.2 ), based on a randomized block design.

and neotissue treatment.  
3.2.2. Perfusion Bioreactor System  
 COLI scaffold templates were  secured to a movable horizontal bar under continuous 
uniaxial static tension and maintained inside a custom -designed bioreactor chamber that is 
connected to a perfusion system. The perfusion system consists of a 10 ml medium re servoir 
(Synthecon, Houston, TX) that permits gas exchange while a computer -controlled peristaltic pump 
(Ismatec 404b, Glattbrugg, Switzerland) maintains a bidirectional fluid flow rate of 1 ml/min. The 
cells were  infused into COLI scaffold templates (6.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm3) at 1.0 x 106 cells/cm3 scaffold 
template through the injection port of each chamber and maintained in tenogenic (DMEM -high 
glucose, 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 ng/ml transforming growth factor (TGF) -β1, 50 mM L -
ascorbic acid 2 -phosphat e sesquimagnesium salt hydrate, 0.5 mg/ml insulin, 1% antibiotics) or 
stromal (DMEM -F12, 10% FBS, 1% antibiotics) medium. The perfusion system was maintained 
in 5% CO 2 at 37°C for 21 days with medium changes every 7 days.  
3.2.3. Elongated calcaneal  Tendin opathy Models  
 Both Sprague Dawley  (SD)  and RNU nude (RNU) r ats aging 8 – 10 weeks old and 
weighing 200 – 250 g were obtained from a vendor ( Charles River Laboratories , Wilmington, 
134 
 MA). Elongation -induced calcaneal tendinopathy was created in both hindlimbs of rats using an 
adaptation of an elongation device validated for canine cranial cruciate ligament elongation187.  
 Briefly, rats were  induced and maintained  with isofluorane ( 2.0%) in 100% oxygen at a 
flow rate of 1L/min inside a n induc tion chamber and then a facemask. Premedica tion w as gi ven 
by subcutaneous injec tion of glycopyrrolate (0.02 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.5 mg/kg). Following 
aseptic preparation, L -shaped skin incisions w ere made superior and lateral to each calcaneal 
tendon to elevate the skin. After carefully excising the paratenon of each calcaneal tendon, fine 
grit stainless steel n ail file was placed underneath the tendon to prevent slippage during force 
application.  
 Single-interrupted # 4-0 Vicryl® sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, N J) were  placed through the 
calcaneal tendon with the distal suture just proximal to the calcaneus and the proximal suture at 
the junction of the calcaneal tendon and gastrocnemius muscle. A spring scale was  used to apply 
2.5 N of tension to the proximal  aspect of the calcaneal tendon  via stainless steel S -shape hook 
and # 0 PDS® II suture  (Ethicon) . The distance between the distal edge of the proximal suture and 
the proximal edge of the distal suture was measured during force application to determine the pre -
elongation length (PrE) with a vernier caliper.  
 The tendon elongation device has a hollow cylinder (7.5 mm inner diameter; 10 mm outer 
diameter) with a 2.5 mm -wide textured (80 grit) rim. Within the cylinder, a removable 10 -gauge 
stainless steel hook (5 mm diameter, 2 mm depth) is attached to a retractable ratchet system that 
locks every 1.5 mm . The hook was placed beneath calcaneal tendon midway between sutures. The 
textured surface of the cylind er engaged with the tendon surface by pressing the device firmly to 
prevent slippage during hook retraction and limit elongated tissue to the area with in the inner 
diameter of cylinder. The hook was retracted 1 ratchet step (1.5 mm) to elongate the isolated 135 
 section by 8 ratchet steps (12 mm) and held for 1 mi nute until release.  
 Post-elongation length (PoE) was determined identically to the PrE, and per cent elongation 
(PE) w as calculated as PE = (PoE−PrE)/PrE × 100. Skin w as approximated with #  4-0 Vicryl® 
sutures in a simple continuous subcuticular suture pattern. The suture line  was be sealed with tissue 
adhesive. Post-medica tion w as gi ven by subcutaneous injec tion of carprofen  (5 mg/kg) , 
enrofloxacin  (10 mg/kg) , and 5 ml of warmed 0.9% saline . 
3.2.4. COLI Construct Implantation  
 Six days after tendon elongation surgeries, ASC -COLI constructs cultured in tenogenic or 
stromal medium, or PBS were  implanted via needle under general an esthe sia identically as for 
surgery.  
 A half of cylindrical piece ( 4 mm diameter, 10 mm thickness ) collected from construct 
using biopsy punch was placed int o the tip of a 18-gauge 1.5 inch needle (Exel international, 
Salaberry -de-Valleyfield , Canada), 20 -gauge 1 inch needle ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes, 
NJ) inserted into 18 -gauge needle from the tip  side, then construct pushed into 20 gauge needle 
using stylet of 22 -gauge 1 inch IV catheter ( Terumo Medical Corporation , Southaven, MS ). 
 After aseptic preparation of hindlimb, 20 -gauge needle was inserted transdermally into 
calcaneal tendon to proximal end of tendon, and construct was implanted by advancing 22 -gauge 
IV catheter stylet inside 20 -gauge needle while withdrawing needle.   
 The procedure was performed on both limbs, with one randomly assigned to receive a 
tenogenic ASC -COLI construct, while th e other receive d a stromal ASC -COLI construct or PBS 
(0.5 ml). Rats were  maintained in cages without movement restriction  for 6 weeks after which th ey 
were  humanely sacrificed according to current AVMA standards and calcaneal tendons harvested.

Stylet of 22 -gauge 1 inch IV catheter was inserted into 20 -gauge needle (C) and advanced while 
withdrawing needle  to implant construct .  
3.2.5. Functional Outcome  
All rats w ere monitored once  daily for signs of pain according to the Rat Grimace Scale 
(RGS)192,193, and for excessive swelling, redness or drainage at the surgery site. A scoring system 
previously developed to evaluate rat limb use194 was used to evaluate  limb use  one week befo re 
surgery, daily up to 14 days after surgery, and then weekly up to 6 weeks.  
138 
 3.2.6. Microstructure  
A quadrant of calcaneal tendon w as fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA), paraffin 
embedded, sectioned (5 μm) and stained with haematoxylin and eosin or Masson’s trichrome. 
Digital images generated with a slide scanner (NanoZoomer, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K , 
Hamamatsu City,  Japan) or a light m icroscope (DM4500B, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) fitted with 
a digital camera (DFC480, Leica)  and c ellular morphology, distribution, and extra cellular matrix 
organization  were be evaluated .  
3.2.7. Gene Expression - Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reac tion (RT -PCR)  
A quadrant of calcaneal tendon w as snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to a  
cooled grinding cylinder of BioPulverizer (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK ) and pulverized.195 Ground 
sample s were collected by rinsing the cylinder with 1 ml of TRI reagent® (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)  
and transferred to 1.5 ml tube. Ground sample was  homogenized by passing mixture through 18 -
gauge needle 30 times. Total RNA was extracted from supernatant by phenol -chloroform 
extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated RNA w as cleaned up by RNeasy® 
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA 
synthesi s (QuantiTect® Reverse Transcript ion Kit, QIAGEN). Rat-specific primers for tendon -
specific genes, collagen 1a1  (Col1a1 ), collagen 3a1  (Col3a1 ), tenascin -c (Tnc), scleraxis  (Scx), 
and tenomodulin  (Tnmd ) were quantified  using primers previously validated.126 PCR was 
performed with denaturation step at 9 5°C for 15 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 
94 °C for 15 seconds , annealing at 52 °C for 30 s econds,  and elongation at 72°C for 30 s econds 
using SYBR Green system (QuantiTect® SYBR® Green PCR Kits, QIAGEN) . Relative gene fold 
change was determined by standard means (2-ΔΔCt). Glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase  
(GAPDH ) was used as the reference gene.   139

3.2.8. Statistical Analysis  
 Results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean  (SEM) . Normality of data was 
examined with the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test. Measures of functional outcome, post -elongation 
percentages, and post -elongation tendon width were compared with ANOVA  among  groups . 
When overall difference was detected, pairwise compariso ns between groups were performed 
using Tukey’s post -hoc test.  Fold changes of tenogenic gene expression were compared : to 1 using 
one sample t -test and between groups using two-sample t -test for normally distributed results ; and 
to 1 using Wilcoxon signed rank test and between groups using Mann Whitney test  for non -
normally distributed results. All analyses were  conducted using Prism  (GraphPad Software Inc. , 
San Diego, CA ) with significance considered at p  < 0.05.  
3.3. Results  
3.3.1. Functional Outcome  
 Following elongation injuries, functional scores dramatically decreased despite rats were 
ambulatory all the time. Additionally, minimum swelling was noted at the surgery site without 
signs of infections or excessive inflammation for all rats. Functional scores gradually recovered 140 
 over 6 -week period for both SD and RNU rats ( Fig 3.5). However, SD rats appeared to have better 
recovery of limb use than RNU rats by the end of post -operative period. After 6 weeks of post -
operative period, neither SD ra ts nor RNU rats fully regained original limb function.  
 In SD rats, functional score s had a trend of low values in PBS treatment group compared 
to tenogenic construct or stromal construct groups after 10 days post -operatively. There appeared 
to be no difference in functional scores between tenogenic construct and stromal construct groups 
(Fig 3.5.A).  On the contrary, there was no  trend of  difference in functional scores among treatment 
groups for RNU rats all the time ( Fig 3.5.B).  Compared to SD rats, functional recovery of limbs 
in RNU rats appeared to be biphasic rather than continuous.  
 
Figure  3.5. Functional score of hindlimbs in SD (A) and RNU (B) rats from pre -injury to 6 
weeks post -injury.  Functional scores were obtained for limbs that received tenogenic constructs 
(blue), stromal constructs (orange), or PBS (black). Each treatment w as administered at day 6.   
3.3.2. Post-Elongation Percentage and  Tendon Width  
 Percentage of elongation did not differ among treatment groups for SD rats ( Fig 3.6.A). 
Overall elongation percentage was  54.24  ± 3.756 %. Elongation percentages were generally higher 
than those that may lead to acute rupture. As a result, loosened midportion of calcaneal tendon 
following elongation between sutures was noted ( Fig 3.3.J). Individually, elongation percentages 
141 
 were  60.12  ± 6.666 % for tenogenic construct group, 50.65  ± 3.889 % for stromal construct group, 
and 43.79  ± 4.984 % for PBS group. Variation in elongation percentages was higher in tenogenic 
construct group, and as high as 144% of elongation was achieved without causing complete 
rupture.  
 Six weeks post -injury, the widths of healed calcaneal tendon at midportion was higher in 
tenogenic construct group ( 2.444  ± 0.1175  mm) compared  to PBS group ( 1.903  ± 0.08724  mm) . 
Widths of calcaneal tendon in stromal construct gr oup ( 2.164  ± 0.1088  mm) were not different 
from tenogenic construct group or PBS group ( Fig 3.6.B).  There was no visible partial or complete 
rupture noted in gross appearance of healed tendons among all treatment groups.  
 
Figure  3.6. Post elongation percentage (A) and tendon width at harvest (B) of SD rats.  Post 
elongation percentage was determined at the time of surgery and width measured at tissue 
harvest for each tendon of all rats.   
 Similar to SD rats, p ercentage of elongation did not  differ among treatment groups for 
RNU rats ( Fig 3.7.A). Overall elongation percentage was 70.17  ± 6.297 % and appeared to be 
higher than that for SD rats . Individually, elongation percentages were 68.91  ± 10.64 % for 
tenogenic construct group, 55.72  ± 6.789 % for stromal construct group, and 87.16  ± 9.224 % for 
PBS group. Variation in elongation percentages was again higher in tenogenic construct group, 
142 
 and as high as 1 50% of elongation was achieved without causing complete rupture.  High 
variability demonstrated less control in size of injury compared to transection of tendon.  
 Unlike SD rats, the widths of healed calcaneal tendon at midportion in RNU rats 6 weeks 
after injury were not different among treatment groups ( Fig 3.7.B). In dividually, widths were 2.082  
± 0.04139  mm for tenogenic construct group, 2.012  ± 0.06183  mm for stromal construct group, 
and 1.992  ± 0.1262  mm for PBS group . Although non -significant, there was a trend of widest 
tendon widths by tenogenic construct treatm ent, followed by stromal construct and PBS treatment. 
There was also no visible partial or complete rupture noted in gross appearance of healed tendons 
among all treatment groups  in RNU rats .

elongation percentage was determined at the time of surgery and width measured at tissue

3.3.3. Microstructure  
 In calcaneal tendons of SD rats who received tenogenic constructs,  there were no obvious 
regions of distorted cellular alignment or ECM orientation at the midportion where elongation 
injury was created. Implanted t enogenic constructs were clearly identified as cylinder -like 
structure with basophilic  in H & E staining and  light blue in trichrome staining within implanted 
calcaneal tendon of rats at the time of harvest ( Fig 3.8). Although implants were ejected from 
143 
 needle while withdrawing from calcaneal tendon along the entire length, majority of portion of 
implants appear ed to have been deposited at the proximal end of tendons  (Fig 3.8.A) . However, 
lesser amounts of implants were deposited along the entire length of tendons. Implants were 
relatively acellular and mostly consisted of fibrous ECM and diffusely residing fibroblastic cells. 
Cellularity within implants were relatively higher than surrounding native tendon , yet low 
cellularity of implants resembl ed native  tendon tissue.  In terms of immune response to the implan t, 
there were no signs of mononuclear cells’ infiltration, indicating lack of immune response to 
implants. Of note was the presence of red blood cells within empty spaces of implants, which 
suggested neovasculization was also induced  (Fig 3.8.F) . 
 Majority  of cells assumed tenocyte -like morphology with elongated rhomboid nucleus. 
There were areas where cells aligned randomly inside the implant, while there were areas where 
cells obtained parallel alignment with surrounding native tendon ( Fig 3.8.D).  In the areas where 
cells aligned randomly, cells tended to form clusters with relatively higher density. Around those 
areas, fibrous ECM also maintained random alignment.  In the areas where cells aligned parallelly, 
cellularity was lower and cells aligned parallel to the surrounding tendon tissue. Additionally in 
those areas, fibrous ECM within gained parallel alignment as well to the surrounding native 
tendon. Additionally, these ECM developed crimp pattern character istic of tendon tissue  (Fig 
3.8.D) .  
 The immediate adjacent areas of implants did not accumulate fibrotic tissue to sequester 
implant. This again indicated lack of foreign body reaction to implant.  Moreover, there were 
apparent integration of implants wit h surrounding native tendons characterized by gradual 
transition of implants towards native tendons m erging ECMs from both areas ( Fig 3.8.E).  Cells 
within merging areas also appeared to be more elongated mature tenocyte -like cells.  144

Harvested calcaneal tendon was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (A, C, E) or Masson's

and D, are enlarged images represented by red rectangles in panels C, D, A, and B, respectively. 
Scale bars = 1 mm (A, B), 100 μm (C, D), and 25 μm (E, F).   
 Similar to tendons that received tenogenic construct administration, those with stromal 
constructs also lacked obvious disorganized area in the midportion. The implants were also clearly 
identified as cylindrical structure within tendon demarcated from sur rounding tissue. The implants 
did not have infiltrating monocytes or surrounding fibrous encapsulation. Cells within implants 
appeared to be more round to rhomboid with oval nucleus. Implants were high in cellularity and 
contained less  amounts of immature ECM that w as stained  red by trichrome ( Fig 3.9).

Scale bars = 500 μm (A, B), 100 μm (C, D), and 25 μm (E, F).   
 Tendons that received PBS treatment had apparent disorganized areas at the midportion 
characterized by high cellularity and non -parallel alignment of both cells and ECM. However, 
majority of areas within tendon maintained low cellularity with parallel alig nment along with 
longitudinal direction ( Fig 3.10).  There were no signs of hematoma formation at the time of 
harvest. Additionally, abnormal cellular differentiation such as chondrocyte -like or osteocyte -like 
cell formation was not evident as well.

Scale bars = 250 μm (A, B), 100 μm (C, D), and 25 μm (E, F).   
 Similar to tendons of SD rats that received implant treatments, obvious elongation -induced 
lesions were not found in tendons of RNU rats into which t enogenic constructs were implanted. 
Implant s in the tendons  were  clearly  identified as cylindrical structures ( Fig 3.11). They were 
basophilic in H & E stainin g and light blue in trichrome staining. The areas stained red by 
trichrome staining were observed in multiple portions, and it was not consistent finding with 
tenogenic constructs implanted into SD rats’ tendons. The organization of cells and ECM appeared 
147 
 to be less organized than tenogenic constructs implanted in calcaneal tendons of SD rats.  
 Although cellularity was low homogenously, much less cells aligned parallelly to each 
other and to the surrounding native tendons  (Fig 3.11.D) . Distinct forms of EC M were observed 
within implant, which were fibrous and caseous appearance. Among these, fibrous ECM obtained 
parallel to oblique alignment with longitudinal direction of native tendon ( Fig 3.11.F).  Of note was 
stronger blue coloration of fibrous ECM than t enogenic constructs implanted tendons of SD rats 
by trichrome staining. The degree of staining with blue color was almost indistinguishable between 
fibrous ECM within implants and collagen fibers of native tendons, potentially more advanced 
maturity of fib rous ECM.  The same areas with fibrous ECM also had close eosinophilic coloration 
to native collagen fibers. Cells had oval to spindle shape nucleus and populated more frequently 
in the areas where fibrous ECM existed. Cellular nucleus was also intact and n o cells had apoptotic 
or necrotic appearances. Cells were also not assuming chondrocyte -like morphology characterized 
by round cells embedded in hyaline -like ECM, or osteocyte -like morphology characterized by 
calcium deposition around them.  Also, there was  no cells that contain vacuoles resembling 
adipocyte -like cells or macrophages.  
 As expected from immunocompromised status of RNU rats, there was no sign of immune 
reactions characterized by monocyte infiltration or encapsulation of implants by fibrous tissues 
(Fig 3.11.C).  Not only within implants themselves, but also within native tendons around implants 
lacked infiltration of inflammatory cells. Unlike tenogenic constructs implanted into calcaneal 
tendons of SD rats, presence of red blood cell s within implants was not noted, indicating lack of 
neovascularization.  In terms of integration with surrounding native tendon structure, the boundary 
between implants and native tendons was clear and lacked insertion of collagenous fibers from 
native tend ons to implants, suggesting limited integration of implants ( Fig 3.11.C and D).   148

Scale bars = 1 mm (A, B), 250 μm (C, D), and 25 μm (E, F).  
 Clear elongation lesions were not observed in tendons of RNU rats that received stromal 
constructs. Implants appeared similar to those of tenogenic constructs ( Fig 3.12). Cells were 
mostly maintaining viable morphology with intact nucleus. Like tenogenic constructs, both fibrous 
and caceous ECM existed with more cellularity within areas of fibrous ECM ( Fig 3.12.C). The 
organization of fibrous ECM was random, and lesser blue coloration with t richrome staining 
suggested less mature fibers ( Fig 3.12.F). Immune response was not observed.

 In the tendons of RNU rats that received PBS treatment, elongation -induced lesion 
characterized by higher cellularity and disorganized cell -ECM orientation was observed ( Fig 
3.13.A and B, black arrows). However, no areas contained apoptotic - or necrotic -like cells, and 
had excessive inflammatory changes, indicating the tendons were in the phases of both 
proliferative and remodeling ( Fig 3.13.E and F). Some areas had apparent chondroid formation 
with circular non -stained pr oteinaceous deposition that contain round cells ( Fig 3.13.C and D).

3.3.4. Gene Expression - Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT -PCR)  
Regardless of control treatments on contralateral calcaneal tendons, those treated with 
tenogenic constructs had a trend of overall higher expressions of tendon -specific genes within 
each SD rat ( Fig 3.14). Specifically, Col1a1  had a trend of upregulat ion in calcaneal tendons 
treated with tenogenic constructs compared to those treated with stromal constructs  (1.516  ± 
0.5197 -fold) and upregula ted compared to those treated with PBS (2.612  ± 0.5515 -fold) , and the 
151 
 difference between tenogenic constructs and treatments was larger with PBS treatments than 
stromal constructs. Similarly, Col3a1  had a trend of upregulation in calcaneal tendons treated 
with tenogenic constructs compared to those treated with stromal constructs ( 1.488  ± 0.3843 -
fold) and those treated with PBS ( 2.240  ± 0.4108 -fold). Tnc also had a trend of upregulation in 
calcaneal tendons treated with tenogenic constructs compared to thos e treated with stromal 
constructs ( 1.503  ± 0.5312 -fold) and those treated with PBS ( 2.824  ± 0.8847 -fold).  
Although the trend of larger difference between tenogenic constructs and PBS than 
stromal constructs remained same, expression of Scx in calcaneal tendons treated with tenogenic 
constructs appeared to have downregulated compared to those treated with strom al constructs 
(0.7536  ± 0.1462 -fold) or unchanged compared to those treated with PBS ( 1.035  ± 0.04775 -
fold) . And the similar trend was observed also with the expression of Tnmd . The expression of 
Tnmd  in calcaneal tendons treated with tenogenic constructs appeared to have been unchanged 
compared to those treated with stromal constructs ( 1.137  ± 0.2151 -fold) or slightly upregulated 
compared to those treated with PBS ( 1.311  ± 0.2681 -fold). The same trend of higher tendon -
specific gene expressions in calcaneal tendons treated with tenogenic constructs compared to 
contralateral tendons treated with controls was not consistently found in RNU rats (Fig 3.15).  
However, Col1a1  had a trend of upregulation in calcaneal tendons treated with tenogenic 
constructs compared to those treated with stromal constructs ( 1.783  ± 0.07086 -fold) and those 
treated with PBS ( 1.924  ± 0.6127 -fold). In contrast to the trend observed in SD rats, the  
differences between tenogenic constructs and stromal constructs appeared to be larger than PBS 
in Col3a1 , Tnc, and Tnmd .  152

mean ± SEM. Asterisks indicate difference from 1 -fold within each stromal construct and PBS

For example, Col3a1  had a trend of upregulation in calcaneal tendons treated with 
tenogenic constructs compared to those treated with stromal constructs ( 4.010  ± 0.1538 -fold) and 
those treated with PBS ( 1.308  ± 0.2276 -fold). Tnc also had a trend of upregulation in calcaneal 
tendons treated with tenogenic constructs compared to those treated with stromal constructs 
(2.674  ± 0.8937 -fold) and those treated with PBS ( 1.755  ± 0.5960 -fold). And the similar trend 
153 
 was observed also with the expression of Tnmd . The expression of Tnmd  in calcaneal tendons 
treated with tenogenic constructs had a trend of upregulation compared to those treated with 
stromal constructs ( 1.722  ± 0.1576 -fold) and those treated with PBS ( 1.095 ± 0.05383 -fold). The 
expression of Scx in calcaneal tendons treated with tenogenic constructs appeared to be 
unchanged  compared to those treated with stromal constructs ( 0.8518  ± 0.1174 -fold) or 
upregulated  compared to those treated with PBS ( 1.779  ± 0.5199 -fold).

 3.4. Discussion  
3.4.1. Main Findings  
 The major findings of this study w ere: 1) elongation -induced calcaneal tendon of both 
immunocompetent and immunocompromised rats had minimum morbidity on general conditions, 
yet affected limb use was detectable using established rubric; 2)  the recovery of impaired limb use 
corroborated with healed calcaneal tendon with minimum microstructur al derangement; 3) the 
constructs implanted via needle into tendon remained withing implantation cites during 6 weeks 
post-operative period without clear signs of immune response; 4) however, the tenogenic 
constructs formed tendon -like neotissue with elong ated cells aligned in parallel to longitudinal axis 
of tendon, while stromal constructs transformed amorphous tissue with randomly aligned cells that 
contain numerous vacuoles in SD rats; and 5) tenogenic and stromal constructs both formed 
tendon -like neot issue with elongated parallel cells with abundant ECM that appeared to have 
integrated with native orthotopic tendon tissue. Thus, our study suggested neotendon tissue, 
especially the one cultured in tenogenic medium, had a potential to be integrated into native tendon 
tissue and augment healing both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised animals.   
3.4.2. Functional Outcome  
 The elongation -induced injury of rat calcaneal tendons rendered minimum morbidity to the 
general condition of animals, while eliciti ng detectable effects on limb use. The injury created in 
our study by elongation device was unique ly representative of  acute overstrain calcaneal tendon  
injury . In human, a cute calcaneal tendon rupture is the most common tendon rupture in the lower 
extremi ty, and occur typically in individuals who are active only intermittently,196 a different 
etiology from overuse calcaneal rupture. Therefore, although calcaneal tendon rupture was not 
caused in animals , our elongation -induced injury was likely to represent the most common type of 155 
 calcaneal tendon injury in human. A similar strain -induced tendon injury model was reported 
previously using cyclic strain of rat patellar tendon to attain fatigue damage accum ulation.197 And 
this type of injury represents chronic overuse -induced tendinopathy rather than acute tendon 
injury.  
 The limb use of rats after elongation injury in the present study showed immediate  
impair ment  of limb use , yet limb use gradually recovered in both immunocompetent and 
immunocompromised rats. However, impaired limb use was detectable only with the use of 
established rubric, and  rats were ambulatory throughout the study period.  Limb use evaluated in 
our study using subjective scoring showed no difference among treatments regardless of rat 
phenotypes. The reasons for no difference in limb use among treatments may be subjective scoring 
system or lower morbidity rendered to the limb use by elongation injury. It has be r eported  more 
invasive injury creation using enzymatic degradation or surgical transection of tendon led to the 
detection of impaired limb use only by the gait analysis using force measuring platform. For 
example, a  study evaluating limb use after collagena se-induced patellar tendon injury in rats 
observed rather subtle impairment of gait parameters by injuries, and parameter that was associated 
with pain was double stance duration.198 Additionally, s tep length and ground reaction forc es were 
the only affected parameters after RC tear and repair in rats, which was also not different from 
uninjured limb  by day 28 ,199 indicating objective gait analysis system is necessary to detect 
changes in gait after tendon injury and treatment . Another reason for no difference among 
treatments maybe the needle implantation itself might have render ed limb use impairment that 
potentially had larger effects on limb use than treatments themselves. For example , it was reported  
a simple needle injection of saline into tendon severely impaired many of gait parameters evaluated  
in rats .198 Therefore, the injury type and treatment administration modality employed in the present 156 
 study might require objective gait analysis system to detect treatment effects.  
 Of note was that a lthough not stat istically different, the recovery of limb use in 
immunocompromised rats appeared to be slower than that of immunocompetent rats in the present 
study. This indicated immune system plays an important role in healing of tendon injury. As 
athymic RNU rats used in the present study  were depleted of T cells, it was suggested T cells may 
be a crucial part of healing process upon elongation injury. Indeed, in a previous study,  it was 
reported M1/M2 macrophage ratio peaked at day 3, while T helper and Treg cells  increased over 
time during healing of transected calcaneal tendon.200 The importance of T cells in tendon healing 
was also demonstrated in a study reporting expression of chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), an 
important surface marker normally expressed in circulating bone -marrow monocytes and a 
mediator of m acrophage recruitment, in both macrophage and T cells of healthy tendon. And 
knockout of CCR2 resulted in reduced numbers of myofibroblasts and reduced  functional recovery 
during late healing.201  
3.4.3. Post-Elongation Percentage and  Tendon Width  
 With regard to tendon wi dth, it is commonly seen the size of healing tendon assessed by 
cross -sectional area (CSA) or thickness increase after injury. Indeed, ratio of CSA of ruptured 
calcaneal tendons to that of contralateral healthy tendons increased gradually upon primary 
surgical repair up to 6 months and decreased by 12 months in human.202 And several reports 
indicated cellular treatments decrease size of healed tendon. For example, injection of ASCs  was 
reported to decrease thickness of recalcitrant patellar tendinopathy along with decreased pain 
scores in 6 months period.203 On the other hand, other studies reported increased CSA coincided 
with increased maximum load and stiffness of rat calcaneal tendon both after 2 and 4 weeks of 
mid-substance defect creation followed by tendon stem/progenitor cell sheet wrapping compared 157 
 to non -treatment.178 In the present study, the width of the healed calcaneal tendons treated by 
tenogenic constructs were larger than those treated by PBS, which was consistent with the later 
reports. The difference between those studies reporti ng contradicting  effects of cellular therapies 
on size of healed tendon may largely stem from differences in phases  of tendons healing . And it 
may be case that cellular therapies including neotendon in the present study increase tendon size 
during early ph ase of healing after acute injury, whereas treatments decrease size of chronically 
injured tendon. Combined , increase of healed tendon width at earlier stages and decrease at later 
stages both may represent a better healing.  
 In the present study, average 50 – 70% elongation of calcaneal tendon immediately after 
strain application was achieved for both immunocompetent and immunocompromised animals. It 
is an extensive elongation which may result in acute rupture based on establishe d stress -strain 
curve of tendons, since macroscopic rupture starts at above 8% elongation  in human .204 In a 
previous study, the failure strain  of human calcaneal tendon  was on average 12.8% for the bone -
tendon complex and 7.5% for the tendo n substance  at the 1% per second rate strain application, 
whereas me an failure strain was 16.1% for the bone -tendon complex and 9.9% for the tendon 
substance  at 10% rate .205 In uninjured calcaneal tendon of rat, 2 bundles that consist calcaneal 
tendon, plantaris longus and gastrocnemius tendons , both reached approximately 20% strain at 
failure.206 Although the strain at failure of rat calcaneal tendon was reported to be lower than that 
of our study potentially due to different mechanisms of strain application, evide nce suggests rat 
calcaneal tendon tends to withstand higher strain without rupture than human, and it may have led 
to high elongation percentage achieved in the present study. This discrepancy may be attributed to 
extensive rotation of 2 calcaneal tendon b undles in rat,207 which potentially allows more elongation 
under stress.  158 
  In human, elongation of tendon itself occurs normally after healing of acute rupture. For 
example , human calcaneal tendons were reported to elongate 0.15 to 3.1 cm  after acute injury and 
healing,208 approximately 0.8 – 16% elongation of original lengt h, given average length of 
calcaneal tendon is approximately 18 cm.209 In rats, strain at failure of transected and healed 
calcaneal was reported to be approximately 1.0 cm,210 which is close to 70% elongation f or non -
repaired calcaneal tendon. It was also reported primary repair of transected rat calcaneal tendon 
maintain original length of approximately 1.0 cm post -operatively, whereas non -repaired tendon 
resulted in callus formation and approximately 60% incre ase of original length to 1.6 cm after 8 
weeks.211 Although elongation achieved in the present study is not directly comparable to post -
injury calcaneal tendon elongation commonly observed in hum an after acute rupture, our model 
may recapitulate a clinical scenario of strain -induced acute calcaneal tendon rupture in human 
most closely among currently available tendon injury models.  
3.4.4. Microstructure  
 Regardless of recipients’ immune status, t he present study revealed implanted constructs, 
especially those cultured in tenogenic medium, maintained morphologically viable and assuming 
orthotopic tendon characteristics. When placed to fill calcaneal tendon defect of rat, COLI sponge 
itself increase d ultimate failure load, shortened healed tendon, and decreased stiffness than empty 
defect.212 Therefore, COLI sponge has tenoconductive properties. Using this tenoconductive 
properties, COLI sponge ’s most prominent clinical use is to augment primary repair as a patch 
most often combined with RC tear repair.213 The advantage of COLI augmentation was reported 
to be reduced radiographic retear rate, increased complete healing rate, and improved 
functions.213,214 Indeed, cells infiltrate and form immature tendon like neotissue 6 month after 
implantation in human, yet COLI implant itself was found to be absorbed and replace d by newly 159 
 formed tissue.214 Given its relatively small size compared to repaired RC and non -parallel 
collageno us fibers of neotissue, it was unclear whether neotissue formed contributed directly to 
the increased function. Or it may be possible the residual cells within neotissue exerted paracrine 
effects to promote natural healing of repaired RC.  
 This is true especially because addition of cells to collagenous patch led to increased RC 
healing and mechanical property in rat, indicating augmentation of healed tendon size may not be 
the primary benefits of the treatment. In that study, bovine decellularized pericardium colonized 
with ASCs led to better fibrocartilage and tidemark formation at the bone -to-tendon interface, 
increased collagen fiber density, improved fiber orientation, and increased load -to-failure than 
patch only treatment.215 And survival of neotissue implant into tendon may not depend on the 
viability of recipien t tissue. For example, it had been shown that collagen sponge seeded with 
MSCs maintain high cellularity and viability within construct under controlled cyclic tensioning 
after implanted into ovine tendon ex vivo . Although the implants were placed non -viable tissue ex 
vivo in that study, cells maintained viability and uniform distribution within construct most likely 
due the pumping of sponge from cyclic tensioning action that leads to exchange of oxygen and 
nutrients between inside and outside of construct .216 Therefore, survival of cells within implanted 
neotissue in the present study might be aided by the stress -relaxation cycles applied to recipient 
tendons during animals’ ambulation . 
 The constructs implanted into calcaneal tendons of bot h immunocompetent and 
immunocompromised rats had dense ECM structure with few void spaces populated by numerous 
viable cells. The much  dense r structure of constructs found in our study may be due to the presence 
of tenogenically -induced MSCs  or longer post -implantation period after which constructs were 
examined histologically.  On the contrary, it was reported implanted COLI sponge without cells 160 
 into the gap of transected calcaneal tendon of rats formed much less denser crisscross meshwork 
of collagen fiber  bundles that was infiltrated by endogenous fibroblastic cells at 2 weeks.212 
Nonetheless, the less dense structure observed in the COLI implanted calcaneal tendon did not 
lead to inferior mechanical properties compared to the untreated gap that had much dense cellular 
and ECM s tructure.212 Therefore, it is important to evaluate the mechanical properties of healed 
tendons treated by our constructs in the future.  In terms of the difference betw een t he appearance 
of constructs cultured in tenogenic and stromal medium , those cultured in stromal medium  were 
more disorganized with randomly oriented round to oval cells surrounded by much fewer 
collagenous ECMs stained blue with trichrome staining217 after implanted into immunocompetent 
rats. This contradicted the similar composition of constructs cultured in both stromal and tenogenic 
media after implanted into immunocompromised rats. This discrepancy revealed the roles that 
immunology plays to maint ain phenotype of implanted constructs and direct maturation of 
implanted neotissue towards orthotopic tissue.  
 In terms of immunogenicity , pre-implantation differentiation may increase 
immunogenicity of cells. For example, it was reported that undifferenti ated xenogenic human 
MSCs had better retention in subcutaneous space of immunocompetent mice with less lymphocyte 
and macrophage infiltration than osteogenically differentiated MSCs.218 Similarly, allogenic 
MSCs  differentiated to myocytes increased their immunogenicity by upregulating major 
histocompatibility complex  (MHC) -Ia and -II, resulting in earlier elimination from infarcted heart 
of rats and lost functional improvement by 5 months.219 Therefore, pre -implantation differentiation 
may elicit a stronger immune response to both xenogenic and allogenic MSCs, which was in 
contrast to our findings. On the contrary, pre -implantation differentiation is likely to be beneficial 
in terms of maintaining orthotopic phenotype. Previously, MSCs delivered in collagen hydrogel 161 
 implanted into the central defects of ra bbit patellar tendons resulting in ectopic bone formation up 
to 28% of treated tendons.34,220 This indicates that undifferentiated MSCs do  not tend to maintain 
undifferentiated state upon implantation and may differentiate into ectopic lineages.  Our study 
added an insight on mechanisms of this ectopic tissue formation of MSCs to be partly immune -
related.  And t he importance of immune status a s well as scaffold types w as also  previously 
demonstrated clearly in a study investigating sarcoma formation by implanted MSCs. In that study, 
host-derived sarcomas developed , when MSC/ collagen sponge  constructs were implanted 
subcutaneously into syngeneic and immuno compromised mice , but not when  allogeneic MSCs 
were used or MSCs were injected as cell suspensions .221 
 It is of noteworthy that there was no clear evidence of immune response to construct 
cultured in tenogenic medium after implanta tion into immunocompetent animals despite of 
xenogenic materials used for neotendon formulations. The signs of foreign body reaction including 
mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrotic encapsulation of implant were observed in a previous 
study using human  decellularized dermis implanted into rats.222 Those signs were not evident in 
either of constructs cultured in tenogenic or stromal medium in our study, suggesting that the roles 
immune played in formation of amorphous tissue in immunocompetent animals was not likely 
foreign body reaction to eliminate implants.  An example of interplay between immune system and 
differentiation of MSCs was reported in a study that demonstrated myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) cells, a type of aberrant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), impair osteogenesis of MSCs in 
HSCs’ niche that resulted in reduction of hematopoiesis. Interestingly, enforced  osteogenic 
differentiation of MSCs rescued normal hematopoiesis of MDS mice.223 Therefore, orthotopically 
differentiated MSCs are essential components to maintain homeostasis of MSCs -immune 
interactions at each specific niche. Specific to tenocytes, it was reported activated tenocytes by 162 
 pro-inflammatory  cytokines induced partial M1 phenotype polarization by upregulating CD80 
surface expression and downregulating HLA -DR expression, both M1 phenotype markers, of 
macrophage.224 And this M1 polarization of macrophage appeared to be an important component 
of normal tendon healing, as exosomes from M2 macrophage promote peritendinous fibrosis,225 a 
common complication following tendon injur ies. In human,  the involvement of macrophages 
during tendinopathic state was reported by increased presence of macrophages in tendinopathic 
calcaneal tendons.226  
 In our study, calcaneal tendons had mild signs of tendinopathy such as increased cellularity 
or loss of parallel cell al ignment along longitudinal axis regardless of treatment in both 
immunocompetent and immunocompromised rats, and lacked signs of severe tendinopathy such 
as calcified deposits or chondroid formation that can be formed by collagenase injection.227 
Additionally, the lesion was not limited to the mid -substance and found inconsistently throughout 
the length of the tendons. This may be attributed to the large size of hook used t o lift tendons in 
our study and hollow cylinder that was used to prevent slippage of tendon while applying strain. 
As a result, the stress might have concentrated at both proximal and distal contacts between the 
cylinder and tendon. Moreover, robust healin g capacity of rat calcaneal tendon was evident from 
the study reporting reattachment and histological characteristics of only increased cellularity and 
lost parallel fiber orientation as early as 21 days after transection and saline treatment.228 Robust 
healing of tendon was further prominent especially in young rats compared to old rats. For 
example, 20 months old SD rats showed lower histological scores and more adipocyte 
accumulation  combined with decreased synthesis of tendon -related proteins compared to 2 months 
old rats229 which are close age to rats used in our study. Therefore, the effects of each treatment on 
elongation -induced calcaneal tendon injury was not clearly delineated between treatments in the 163 
 present study.    
3.5. Conclusion  
 Collectively, our study indicated a novel elongation -induced calcaneal tendon bilateral 
injury model developed for both immunocompetent and immunocompromised rats closely 
recapitulated acute human calcaneal tendon strain or rupture etiopa thologically, yet rendered 
minimum morbidity to general conditions of animals. The model demonstrated robust capability 
to clearly represent treatment responses that can be depend both on neotissue types but also on 
immunological status of recipient animal s. Neotissues implantation techniques developed in the 
present study via needle and viable implanted neotissues in orthotopic tendon recipient tissue 
established neotissue delivery system without compromising neotissue viability and structural 
integrity. T his was a major advancement in applicability of neotissue without the need of surgical 
implantation. Additionally, tenogenic constructs demonstrated it maintained tendon -like 
phenotype throughout the healing process in immunocompetent animals, which was no t attainable 
by stromal constructs. The neotendon cultured in tenogenic medium may maintain tendon -like 
phenotype upon implantation into injured tendon and augment healing by both integrating into 
native tissue and facilitating endogenous healing by paracr ine effects.

 Chapter  4. Therapeutic Effects of De Novo Tendon Neotissue on Accessory 
Ligament of Deep Digital Flexor Tendon Core Injuries  
4.1. Introduction  
 Tendinopathy and desmitis  comprise a large majority of musculoskeletal injuries that are 
responsible for up to 72% of lost training days and 14% of early retirements by equine athletes .12-
14 Many acute and chronic tendon and ligament lesions are thought to result from focal 
accumulation of microtrauma and poorly organized repair tissue that ca n coalesce into large lesions 
and predispose to spontaneous rupture across  species .18 Low cell numbers and metabolic activity, 
limited blo od supply, and failure of endogenous tenocytes and ligamentocytes to migrate to the 
injury site contribute to poor tissue healing capacity .109,110 Poor or abnormal tissue repair 
contributes to a reinjury rate in horses as high as 67% within 2 years .20,21  
  Administration of exogenous adult multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) is reported to 
augment natural healing in tendon and ligament injuries .29-31 However, treatment efficacy of  
undifferentiated MSCs is limited by low retention rate30,33 and ectopic formation of unw anted 
tissue types.34,35 Evidence sug gests delivery of MSCs cultured on scaffold template and 
differentiated into specific lineages prior to implantation improve retention and function of target 
organ.120 By differentiating equine adipose -derived MSCs (ASCs) into tenocytes on 
biocompatib le112 commercially available FDA -approved colla gen type I (COLI)113,114 that is 
known to support retention of tendon stem cells115 and multipl e differentiation of MSCs ,112,116,117 
we have generated de novo  tendon neotissue  that resemble proliferation -phase healing tendon . 
Tendon neotissue was biocompatible when orthotopically implanted into immunocompetent rat 
calcaneal tendon without eliciting immune response, and formed immature tendon -like tissue with 
excellent integrati on into surrounding native tendon tissue. To further advance this technique 
towards clinical application, evaluation of tendon neotissue in validated equine preclinical 165 
 tendinopathy model is necessary.  
 Equine tendinopathy, especially naturally -occurring t endon injury, resembles human 
tendinopathy etiologically and histologically most  close ly among many species . Tendinopathy in  
both species occur s as a result of  accumulated damage after prolonged, high -intensity exercise, 
and similar extracellular ( ECM ) changes observed at microstructure level.230 
Ultrasonographically, tendon lesions in both species appear as hypoechoic region where teared 
tendon retract and void space filled with fluid.231,232 Majority of equine tendinopathy occurs in 
forelims,233 and t he prevalence of specific tendons affected by tendinopathy was reported to be 
11.1% for forelimb superficial digital flexor tendon ( SDFT ), 3.61% for forelimb suspensory 
ligament ( SL), 0.06% for hindlimb SDFT,  and 0.14% for hindlimb SL .234 Core lesions are among 
the most common type of lesions seen in acute equine tendon and ligament injuries .235 The several 
mechanisms were suggested as the reason for lesion formation at the core of tendon among horses. 
One of them is central fibrils’ tendency to reach the end of the stress -strain curve toe region earlier  
than fibrils  at the periphe ry, resulting in  stress concentration at  the central core region.236 Another 
mechanism of core lesion formation is the thermal damage. It was reported core of equine SDFT 
reaches temperatures as high as 45 °C during high -speed locomotion ,237 and local temperature rise 
above 42.5°C was shown to negatively affect viability of  fibroblast cell.238 
 To replicate the clinical scenario for testing of novel treatment options, lesions can be 
created in the SDFT by chemical47 and surgical30,239,240 means. Among chemical induction of 
tendinopathy models in horses, injection of collagenase is most commonly used method due to its 
relative ease in creating lesions. The method was originally reported as a model for naturally -
occurring tendinopathy due to its similarity in clinical and histological course following injury.241 
To date, the model has been extensively utilized to evaluate the efficacies of multiple modalities 
including pharmaceutical, cellular, and gene therapies.242-245 However, the lesions created by 166 
 collagenase does not morphologically resemble naturally -occurring core lesions both 
ultrasonographically and histologi cally,242,246 and is often associated with uncontrollable 
inflammation in surrounding area.  Moreover, it was reported that tendinopathy induced by 
collagenase results in poor correlation between clinical presentation and micros copical 
characteristics of lesion.247 Elastography, a ultrasound -based modality to measure tissue elasticity, 
is reliably applied to assess naturally -occurring core lesion of equine tendinopathy,248 yet outcomes 
of elastography assessment in collagenase -induced tendinopathy was also reported to be poorly 
correlated with biochemical changes of  tendinopathy,249 further demonstrating the limitations of 
collagenase -induced tendinopathy model.  
 On the contrary, m echanical disruption with surgical instrumentation reduces the risk of 
excessive inflammation and all ows more control of lesion size than chemical injury .240 Surgi cal 
creation of core lesion in equine tendon is most commonly performed by the use of arthroscopic 
burr to make tunnel at the center of SDFT.30,24 0,250 The approach has advantages of not only being 
able to control the size of lesion without causing excessive and uncontrollable inflammation, but 
also it creates pathologically  similar lesion to naturally -occurring tendinopathy. Those 
characteristics included d isrupted collagen fibers, increased glycosaminoglycan content, increased 
presence of tenocytes with plump nuclei, the scarcity of inflammatory cells, increased matrix 
meta lloproteinase (MMP) activity , and neovascularization.250 The model has been widely used to 
evaluate the efficacy of cellula r therapies, with which tenogenically differentiated MSCs and 
undifferentiated ASCs improved regeneration while minimizing scar  formation characterized by 
increased collagen type I deposition and collagen crosslinking with minimum deposition of 
collagen ty pe III and smooth muscle actin .30,46  
 Core lesion creation in SDFT simulates clinical scenario most closely. Additionally, equine 167 
 SDFT, an equivalent of human calcaneal  tendon, shares functionality both as critical energy -
storage systems during high -speed locomotion and patho physiology of tendinopathy from 
accumulate d exercise - and age -related microdamage  preceding rupture.251 This makes equine 
SDFT tendinopathy model also an ideal model for translational preclinical model for human 
tendinopathy research. However, despite of the robust similarity to clinical scenario  and 
translatability to human tendinopathy application , SDFT t endinopathy requires euthanasia for 
evaluation of tissue regeneration  to harvest injured tendon . In this regard, tendinopathy model 
creation in  accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon  (ALDDFT) is an appealing 
alternative, as desmotomy of ALDDF T does not impair horse’s performance and e uthanasia is not 
necessary for  tissue harvest.252 Despite ligament and tendon are anatomically distinguished , 
genetic lineage tracing revealed that both tenocytes and ligamentocytes arise from the same 
progenitor pool ,253,254 suggesting potential interchangeability of both lesion model and treatment 
between tendon and ligament. Due to lower incidence of ALDDFT injuries in horses, it is also 
often considered non -load bearing ligame nt, yet more than 2 -fold higher strain experienced on 
ALDDFT than SDFT, deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), SL at walk was reported.255 
Additionally, n aturally -occurring tendinopathy of ALDDFT is frequently presented as hypoechoic 
core lesion -like area similar to that of SDFT ultrasonographically.256 Using naturally -occurring 
ALDDFT tendinopathy, single injection of tenogenically induced MSCs injection was found to 
improve ultrasonograp hical appearance in 80% of animals.257 Therefore, it is likely that 
experimentally -induced ALDDFT tendon injury model provide robust yet humane preclinical 
model to assess novel regenerative therapies.   
  In this work , a novel  robust yet  nonterminal equine ALDDFT desmitis  model by surgical 
creation of core lesion was established . The model consisted mechanical disrupt ion of ALDDFT  168 
 under controlled surgical conditions, similar to the SDFT model, and then subsequent harvest by 
minor modification of the standard surgical technique for ALDDFT desmotomy .258 The 
established model was  then validated for its robustness to evaluate therapeutic potential of tendon 
neotissue. The hypotheses tested in this study were: 1) core lesion creation in ALDDFT does not 
cause significant morbidity; 2) core lesion created in ALDDFT resembles that of SDFT 
ultrasonographically, allowing morp hological evaluation of lesion and implant; and 3) tendon 
neotissue augment healing of lesion than COLI template or ASCs alone treatments 
micros tructurally . The aims of this study were to evaluate  horses pre -operatively and 11 weeks 
post-operatively for : 1) objective gait  analysis; 2) ultrasonographic morphology of lesion and 
implant; and 3) histological characteristics of lesion and implant  upon treatment by tendon 
neotissue, COLI template, and ASCs.   
4.2. Materials and Methods  
4.2.1. Study Design  
Protoco l (#21-076) was approved by the Louisiana State University Institutional Animal 
Care and Use committee prior to study initiation . Three  adult mares (body condition 4 - 7, 5 - 15 
years, 425 -500 kg) without evidence of forelimb lameness or systemic illness b ased on physical 
exam w ere be selected from the Louisiana State University research herd. A core lesion was 
created in right  forelimb ALDDFT using a technique modified from validated lesion creation in 
SDFT .30,240 Based on existing knowledge, the optimum time to deliver exogenous cells to an 
injured tendon or ligament hors es is around the sixth day after injury at the transition between the 
inflammatory and subacute reparative phases .180 Hence,  6 days after surgery, ligament neotissu e 
generated from male donor ASCs was percutaneously administered to ALDDFT core lesion in a 
horse  via 18-gauge needle  under ultrasonographic guid ance. Using the same administration 169 
 technique, ASCs from same donor in PBS; or COLI template  were  administered to the ALDDFT 
core lesion s of the other horses . The total volume and cell number were  identical between 
treatment and controls. Twelve weeks after lesion creation , ALDDFTs were  harvested from each 
horse . Gait was evaluated at 5, 7, 9, and 11 weeks both after lesion creation and ALDDFT 
harvest. Lesion was evaluated ultrasonographically at 2, 5, 7, 9, and 11 weeks both after lesion 
creation and ALDDFT harvest. Harvested each ALDDFT was  equally divided along the 
midsagittal axis. One half was tested for tensile mechanical properties while the other was 
assessed for ligament -specific gene expression and extracellular matrix composition as well as 
microstructure ( Fig 5.1).

model creation and neotissue treatment.  
4.2.2. Accessory Ligament of the Deep Digital Flexor Tendon (ALDDFT) Core Lesion Model 
Creation  
ALDDFT core lesions were  surgically created with a validated adap tation of an established 
SDFT surgical core lesion model30,240. With patient on left lateral recumbency, right forelimb  was 
clipped with #40 blade and aseptically  prepared. After appropriate drapping of the body,  limb was 
rested on the mayo stand and table height was adjusted according to the surgeon preference. An 
iodine impregnated drape was applied to the limb due to its inadherent nature, and a window was 
cut through it  to make a surgical incision centering over the proximal third of the palmarolateral 
170 
 area where proximal and middle thirds of the metacarpal bone III meet  using #10 blade  
approximately of 6 cm length.  A 1 cm incision was made through carpal retinaculum 3 cm distal 
to the origin of ALDDFT origin using a new #10 blade. Paratenon was bluntly dissected with 
metzenbaum scissors to isolate ALDDFT from deep digital flexor tendon ( DDFT ). ALDDFT was 
elevated using curved crile forceps, and a 2.8 -mm trocar intramedullary (IM) pin (Jorgensen 
Laboratories, Inc., Loveland, CO) was inserted from proximal end of isolated ALDDFT, 
approximately 8 cm distal from accesso ry carpal bone.  
IM pin was advanced distally inside the ligament core for 4 cm by marking IM pin with 
predetermined distance using sterile marker pen. Subsequently, a 2.0 -mm small -joint hooded 
abrasion burr (2.0 mm x 8.0 mm: stryker®, 0375 -641-000) was in serted slowly into the tunnel to 
the end of probed tunnel. Once reached the distal end of tunnel, burr was activated while gradually 
removing burr from tunnel. Tunnel was further widened with 4.0 -mm tomcat cutter (stryker®, 
375-545-000) using the same moti on. Paratenon and subcuataneous tissues were sutured in a 
simple continuous pattern with poliglecaprone 25 (MONOCRYL® 2 -0 USP; Ethicon, Norderstedt, 
Germany). Skin was closed using skin stapler (35 wide, Midwest Veterinary Supply, Inc., 
Lakeville, MN). Bot h longitudinal and transverse images were obtained ultrasonographically to 
document the size and shape of core lesion . 
4.2.3. Neotendon Implantation  
 Six days after creation of the ALDDFT core lesion, 3 cylinders, 4.0 x 10.0 mm (diameter 
x length), of neotendon placed at the tip of  an 18-gauge 1.5 inch needle (Exel international ) were  
injected into core lesion of a horse using ultrasound guidance with the horse under standing 
sedation and local cutaneous/subcutaneous anesthesia with carbocain e (2%, 5 – 10 m l)259. 
 171 
  
Figure 4.2. Surgical ALDDFT core lesion creation.  The ALDDFT is exposed through a 6 cm 
incision (A). An IM pin is inserted  from proximal end of isolated ALDDFT, approximately 8 cm 
distal from accessory carpal bone. IM pin was advanced distally inside the ligament core for 4 
cm by marking IM pin with prede termined distance using sterile marker pen  to create a tunnel 
(B). A 2.0-mm small -joint hooded abrasion burr was inserted slowly into the tunnel to the end of 
probed tunnel. Once reached the distal end of tunnel, burr was activated while gradually 
removing  burr from tunnel (C). Tunnel was further widened with 4.0 -mm tomcat cutter using the 
same motion (D).    
 To place neotendon  into the needle tip, cylinders were collected from construct cultured 
for 21 days in ligamentogenic medium using 4.0 mm diameter biopsy punch after finger trap suture 
removal and unwrapping of construct.  Neotendon  cylinders were inserted from the tip of needle 
using stylet of 18-gauge intravenous catheter. Needle was inserted at the proximal level of core 
lesion under ultrasound guidance perpendicular to the limb to the center of lesion. Neotendon  was 
administered into the core lesion by gradually advancing stylet of 18 -gauge intravenous catheter 
from the side of hub to the predetermined length of 55.0 mm ( Fig 5.3).  
 The other  horse s receive d ASCs in PBS  or COLI template. ASCs (3.77 x 105 cells) from 
same donor at P2 were resuspended in identical volume (377 mm3) and injected v ia needle. Three 
cylinders of COLI template , 4.0 x 10.0 mm (diameter x length), were injected identically as 
neotendon .

Figure 4.3. Neotendon  implantation into the core lesion of ALDDFT.  Neotendon  cylinders were  
placed at the tip of 18-gauge needle and pushed inside using 18 -gauge intravenous catheter  stylet 
(A). Neotendon  was ejected from the tip of 18 -gauge needle by passing stylet through the needle 
(B). Needle was inserted at the proximal level of core lesion under ultrasound guidance 
perpendicular to the limb to the center of lesion  (C). Neotendon  was administered into  the core 
lesion by gradually advancing stylet of 18 -gauge intravenous catheter from the side of hub to the 
predetermined length of 55.0 mm  (D).  
4.2.4. Post-operative Care and Rehabilitation  
 Horses w ere housed in stalls from 1 day before to 5 weeks afte r each surgical procedure of 
lesion creation and ALDDFT harvest. Horses receive d phenylbutazone (2g, IV) the day of surgery 
and for 10 consecutive days ( 1g, PO, q 12h). All horses also receive d 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (21 mg/kg, PO, q12h) for 10 days. The limb w as supported with a 
Robert Jones bandage that was changed every other day for 1 4 days. Horses under went  a standard 
rehabilitation regimen for ALDDFT desmotomy260 after each post-operative procedure. 
Specifically, horses were restricted to stall confinement without exercises for 14 days. 
173 
 Subsequently, they w ere walked f or 5, 10, and 15 minutes per day, at 3, 4, and 5 weeks post-
operatively . Following completion of a 5 -week rehabilitation, horses were housed in a small 
paddock. After 90 days in a small paddock, horses w ere allowed to gradually increase exercise 
over 18 we eks, after which they w ere allowed to resume full exercise.  
4.2.5. Objective Gait Analysis  
 Gait analysis was conducted 1 day before and 5, 7, 9, and 1 1 weeks after each surgical 
procedure of core lesion creation  and ALDDFT harvest . Horses were trotted on a 900 x 900 mm 
force platform embedded in the center of a 40 m concrete runway (Model #BP900900, Advanced 
Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown, MA)  by experienced handlers . A minimum of 5 trials 
per side (left and right) were  colle cted at a velocity of 2.0 – 3.8 m/s and acceleration of - 0.9 to 0.9 
m/s2. Ground reaction forces w ere recorded at a rate of 1000 Hz and processed with commercially 
available software (Acquire V7.3, Sharon Software Systems, Bengaluru, India). Measured forc es 
included y (craniocaudal, braking and propulsion) and z (vertical) peak force and impulse. Percent 
change in each GRF measure was calculated as [(GRF after treatment  – GRF at baseline)/(GRF at 
baseline)] × 100  at each time point .  
4.2.6. Ultrasonographi c Evaluation  
Evaluation was conducted to obtain pre -operative, immediately post -operative,  and at 2, 5, 
7, 9, 11 weeks post-operative images of each surgical procedure . A real -time B -mode ultrasound 
machine with a 12 mHz linear array probe was used. Both longitudinal and cross -sectional images 
were  captured to evaluate fiber parallelism and ligament versus lesion area, respectively. Images 
were evaluated by investigator s unaware of treatments.  174 
 4.2.7. ALDDFT Harvest  
Twelve weeks after creation of the lesion, the ALDDFT  was harvested through the same 
surgical approach used to create the lesion. Following digital document of the ALDDFT gross 
appearance, the excised tissue was divided along the sagittal direction into longitudinal medial and 
lateral halves through the center of the lesion. Randomly selected on e half w as assigned to 
microstructure analysis . Cubes (1 .0 × 1.0 × 1.0 cm) were  collected from both visible lesion s filled 
and unfilled with implants .  
4.2.8. Microstructure  
Samples collected from ALDDFT  were  fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA)  at 4 °C 
overnight , paraffin embedded, sectioned (5 μm) and stained with haematoxylin and eosin or 
Masson’s trichrome. Digital images were generated with a slide scanner (NanoZoomer, 
Hamamatsu Photonics K.K , Hamamatsu City,  Japan) or a light microscope (DM4500B, Leica, 
Wetzlar, Germany) fitted with a digital camera (DFC480, Leica)  and c ellular morpholo gy, 
distribution, and extra cellular matrix organization  were be evaluated.   
4.2.9. Statistical Analysis  
 Results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean  (SEM) . Normality of data was 
examined with the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test. Percent changes of ground reaction at each time 
period was compared to baseline (0%) using one -sample t -test for normally distributed data and 
one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test for non -normally distributed data. Outcome  measures w ere 
compared with ANOVA . When overall difference was detected, pairwise comparisons between 
groups were performed using Tukey’s post -hoc test.  All analyses were  conducted using Prism  
(GraphPad Software Inc. , San Diego, CA ) with significance considered at p  < 0.05.  175 
 4.3. Results  
4.3.1. Objective Gait Analysis  
 The objective gait analysis of horse that received COLI template treatment  showed  increase 
in PVF on z -axis at 9 ( 4.99 ± 0.62%) and 11 (2.7 ± 0.32%) weeks post -injury compared to pre -
injury baseline ( Fig 4.4 and Table  4.1). Similarly, Imp on z -axis increased at 7 (8.55  ± 1.86%) and 
11 (11.06 ± 0.21%) weeks. PVF on y(b) -axis increased at 9 ( 18.09 ± 2.38%) weeks, and Imp on 
y(b)-axis increased both at 9 ( 25.93 ± 4.72%) and 11 ( 25.93 ± 6.93%) weeks. There was no 
difference in PVF and Imp of y(p) -axis at all post -injury time points.  
 In the horse treated with  tenogenic construct , PVF on z -axis increased at  5 (27.23  ± 
2.109 %), 7  (16.29  ± 0.8142 %), 9 ( 23.04  ± 0.6371 %), and 11 ( 14.46  ± 0.7545%) weeks  (Fig 4.5 
and Table  4.2). Imp on z -axis increased at 5 (18.48  ± 3.387 %), 7 (17.34  ± 1.032 %), 9 (19.37  ± 
1.177 %), and 11 ( 13.67  ± 1.291 %) weeks. PVF on y(b) -axis increased at 7 (111.5  ± 16.10 %), 9 
(88.89  ± 10.52 %), and 11 ( 86.83  ± 14.94 %) weeks , and Imp on y(b) -axis increased both at 9 ( 127.8  
± 10.39 %) and 11 ( 133.3  ± 24.22 %) weeks. PVF on y(p) -axis decreased at 7 ( -10.34  ± 2.729 %) 
and 11 ( -21.71  ± 4.218 %) weeks, and Imp on y( p)-axis decreased at  11 (-22.58  ± 6.035 %) weeks . 
 In contrast to those with COLI template or tenogenic construct treated horses, ob jective 
gait analysis of horse treated with undifferentiated  ASCs had overall decreased parameters 
throughout the post injury period. For example, PVF on z -axis decreased at 5 ( -3.875  ± 0.7615 %), 
7 (-15.95  ± 0.5830 %), and 9 ( -4.895  ± 0.8403 %) weeks ( Fig 4.6 and Table  4.3). Similarly, Imp on 
z-axis decreased at 5 (-16.76  ± 1.313 %), 7  (-23.93  ± 0.8107 %), 9 ( -11.53  ± 1.669 %), and 11 ( -
13.76  ± 0.6678 %) weeks. PVF on y(b) -axis decreased at 7 ( -15.74  ± 5.141 %), yet increased at 11 
(37.32  ± 6.718 %) weeks. Imp on y(b) -axis increased at 11 ( 53.33  ± 9.718 %) weeks. Imp on y(p) -
axis increased at 9 ( 30.77  ± 7.195 %) weeks.  176

 4.3.2. Ultrasound  Analysis  
 Core lesions initially appeared as hypoechoic round to oval areas  with smooth boundaries  
in transverse plane , and  gradually increased in echogenicity with less discernable boundaries by 
the end of the evaluation period regardless of treatment (Fig 4.7.A). Additionally, there was a 
trend of increased irregularities in morphology, and lesions  conformed stellar morphology from 
which multiple fissures appeared to have propagated since 5 weeks post -injury.  
The core lesion CSA percentage ( Fig 4.7.B) increased to 250.4% of the pre -treatment 
CSA 4 weeks after COLI administration , after which it decrea sed to less than the pre -treatment 
CSA. After neotendon  treatment, the core lesion CSA remained stable and did not exceed 
122.2% of original size  throughout the post -injury period . With ASC treatment, the core lesion 
CSA increased to 198.9% of the pre -treatment CSA by 6 weeks post -treatment, decreased to 
80.5% at 8 weeks, and increased to 228.9% by 11 weeks.  
The total CSA of ALDDFT itself was subjectively increased from pretreatment 1 week 
post-injury, immediately prior to treatment, and remained enlarged regardless of treatment.  On 
the other hand, there was no clear effect of injury to surrounding tissue, such as enlarged 
neighboring tendons or induced tendon sheath effusion. Increased size of the structure was also 
detectable by palpation during routine p hysical examination.  There were no pathologic changes 
noted in the SL, DDFT or SDFT.  
The COLI and neotenton were  evident in the core lesion with ultrasound immediately 
after administration. By 11 weeks post -treatment, echogenicity of the core lesion subjectively 
increased up to ≥ 90%  of native tissue echogenicity, respectively, at the level of the largest CSA.  
Furth er, the fissures from lesions appeared to have closed by 11 weeks post -injury.  180

 4.3.3. Microstructure  
 In the tendon that received COLI template treatment, a distinct gross difference existed 
between the core lesion filled with COLI template (Fig 4.8.a and b) and empty core lesion (Fig 
4.8.c and d). Implant was smooth and shiny in appearance and yellow in color. It was firmly 
adhered to the wall of core lesion. Implant filled almost all  inner space of lesion spanning proximal 
half. The inner space of empty core lesion had narrower diameter, indicating contraction of 
surrounding native tendon tissue. The core lesion filled with COLI template had fibrotic scar tissue 
around the lesion char acterized by white coloration (Fig 4.8.A upper rectangle). The surrounding 
areas lacked signs of necrosis or hematoma, and had minimum cellularity mostly consisted of 
fibrous ECM. In contrast, COLI template implanted (Fig 4.8.a and b, dotted lines) had num erous 
cellular infiltration with moderate amounts of randomly organized fibrous ECM. Cells contained 
round and rhomboid nucleus, representing both immature fibroblast -like cells. Although there was 
no clear infiltration of mononuclear cells, notable amount s of cells that contain eosinophilic 
granules were found inside the implant. Those cells had unsegmented nucleus, indicating they 
were unlikely to be eosinophils. Of note was no ectopic chondroid or bone formation observed 
based on the absence of chondrocy te-like cell or osteocyte -like cell formation within implant. The 
empty core lesion had gross dark red coloration, indicating the presence of hematoma or necrosis 
(Fig 4.8.A, lower rectangle). Microscopically, the surrounding areas of empty core lesion had  
necrosis characterized by severely degraded short fibers of disorganized ECM populated with 
scant  cells (Fig 4.8.c and d) . The cells within this region had non-fragmented intact rhomboid 
nucleus, indicating  the area of tendon was in proliferation state in filtrated by fibroblastic cells. 
There was almost no red blood cells found within lesion and surrounding areas .   182

transected ALDDFT (A). Core lesion area filled with COLI template was enlarged in a and b. 
Core lesion area without filling by COLI template was enlarged in c and d. Insets in a – d (a1 – 
d1) are  enlarged. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded ALDDFT specimen  was sectioned at 5 μm, 
followed by H & E (a, c, a1, and c1) and Masson’s trichrome (b, d, b1, and d1) staining. COLI 
template filling core lesion was indicated by dashed lines. Scale bars = 100 μm  (a – d) and 50 μm 
(a1 – d1).  
 The core lesion was grossly filled with neotissue  that had yellow to brown color and 
gelatinous appearance 12 week post -operatively, and obvious necrosis was not found in 
surrounding region of core lesion  (Fig 4.9.A and B , white arrows ). Area surrounding core lesion 
183 
 had indistinguishable color and fibrou s appearance, indicating no clear fibrotic areas existed . 
Microscopically, core lesion was not clearly discernable from surrounding healthy tissue except 
an area with the remaining implanted neotendon (Fig 4.9.C and D, red rectangles) that had 
characterist ic high cellularity and more random cellular alignment compared to healthy ligament 
tissue. Since, there was nearly no remaining void space within healed ligament, no areas that 
contain serous or hematous fluids accumulation.  The implanted neotendon had di stinct 
characteristics of high cellularity with relative random alignment than native tissue (Fig 4.9.E and 
F), yet cells at the peripheral area of implanted neotendon attained oval to oblong nucleus aligning 
along the longitudinal axis of recipient ligame nt (Fig 4.9. G and H). Additionally, some areas in 
neotendon had an extensive deposition of fibrous de novo  ECM within which cells were aligned 
in parallel and gained wavy cell -ECM organization. Of note was the size of cells in the core region 
of neotendon  tended to be larger and appeared to have aligned in concentric.  Although there was 
no clear signs of mononuclear cells infiltration or giant cell formation within neotendon , smaller 
area of healed ligament contained chondrocyte -like cells characterized by  lacunae around 
themselves and hyaline -like ECM deposited in surrounding area ( Fig 4.9 G and H). This indicated 
a certain degree of incomplete healing was present.    
 The core lesion remained unfilled throughout 12 week post -operatively in the ALDDFT of 
horse treated with ASCs, and hollow core lesion was grossly evident  (Fig 4.10.A, white arrow ). 
Area surrounding core lesion had white coloration compared to native red ligament, indicating 
fibrotic scar tissue formation . Microscopically, unfilled core lesion  was evident in the center of 
ALDDFT (Fig 4. 10.B and C), and there was no obvious necrotic region characterized by cells with 
fragmented nucleus or debris of ECM surrounding the core lesion (Fig 4. 10.C). Although 
surrounding areas of core lesion were not n ecrotic, ECM  was short and randomly aligned.  184

4.4. Discussion  
4.4.1. Main Findings  
 The main findings of this study were: 1) surgically -induced core lesion in equine ALDDFT 
caused minimum and transient impairment in limb use; 2) removal of ALDDFT also did not cause 
limb use impairment or systemic adverse effects; 3) core lesion was identi fied as cylindrical 
hypoechoic lesion in the center of ALDDFT post -injury  similar to that of naturally -occurring core 
lesion ; 4) CSA of core lesion transiently increased and echogenicity increased overtime  again 
186 
 similar to the trend normally observed in na turally -occurring core lesion ; 5) core lesion remained 
void surrounded by  necrotic area when lesion was not filled with implant  12 weeks post -injury; 6) 
COLI implantation filled core lesion with surrounding fibrotic scar tissue without  necrosis; 7) 
neotend on implantation led to filled core lesion with premature to mature tendon -like tissue and 
neotendon  itself formed premature tendon -like tissue that integrated to surrounding non -fibrotic 
native tissue ; and 8) ASCs injection did not fill the core lesion yet  led to premature healing tendon 
tissue at the peripheral of lesion characterized by high cellularity and fragmented ECM fibers . 
Combined, the surgically -induced core lesion in equine ALDDFT elicit similar  clinical 
presentation to that  of naturally -occurri ng ALDDFT injury, and has robust potential to evaluate 
distinct responses to different  treatments.   
4.4.2. ALDDFT Core Lesion Model Creation  
 Horse is an ideal animal model for tendon and ligament injury because of the similarity 
with human in terms of rel ative size and function of tendon and ligament. Additionally, horse is 
one of the few animal species that naturally develop tendon/ligament injury beside human . These  
make horse the most suitable for translational study of chronic tendinopathy/ligamentopathy 
treatment. Similar size of horse tendon/ligament with those of human allows application of similar 
diagnostic tools such as US and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  as well as surgical tools for 
reconstruction.30,261 Due to natural tendency to develop injury, an established rubric for evaluating 
ultrasonographic images and pain associated with tendon/ligament injury are also 
available.46,262,263 Functionally, it was suggested human tendons have lower energy -storing 
capacity measured as higher hysteresis than most animals including horses.264,265 However, it was 
reported ALDDFT of equidae experience approximately 5% strain during walking,255,266 which is 
within a physiological range of human tendons.267-269 Moreover, tendons of equidae are like ly to 187 
 be under physiological load of approximately 1,000 – 4000 N,255 higher than that of ovine tendons 
which is below 310 N.270 Additionally, horse flexor tendons have closer strength measured as 
maximum stress to human Achilles tendon than sheep Achilles tendon .271-273 Therefore, among 
quadrupedal animals, horse is the closest to human in terms of mechanical properties, since human 
tendons such as calcaneal tendon can be exposed to as high as 9,000 N during physiological 
motions.274 As a result, horse tendons have been historically compared to those of human 
mechanically and histologically.275 
 However, the use of horse as an animal model has disadvantages of ethical concern due to  
horse’s status as companion animal and the higher cost associated with raising and maintaining 
skeletally mature horse , as well as specific husb andry  requirements . Thus, the non -terminal 
ALDDFT injury model developed in this study addresses both disadvantages of ethical concern 
and higher cost by limiting morbidity to minimum and allowing reuse of horses in multiple 
investigation, which ultimately  leads to significant improvement of 3R concept (Replacement, 
Reduction, Refinement)  and cost performance .276 Historically, h orses have been reused in multiple 
investigations with appropriate interval and careful assessment,277 because th ey are ideal animal 
for a wide variety of fields such as reproductive research as well as educational purpose.278 
Therefore, this versatility of horse as both research and educational animal makes this model 
successful in addressing existing limitations.  To date, non -terminal equine musculoskeletal injury 
model developed includes post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) model that recapitulate human 
PTOA pathology has been previously established using horses,279 and used in many investigations.  
Another advantage of the mo del developed in this study is the availability of multi -sampling. 
Multi -sampling allows the application of repeated measures on study outcomes and increase 
statistical power.280 Multi -sampling is available from large tendon such as SDFT in the form of 188 
 biopsy without the need for sacrifice,43 yet this prevents mechanical testing of healed tendon which 
normally requires entire section of tendons. On the contrary, the model developed in this study 
allows removal of maximum 4 whole ALDDFT s without significant morbidity. Moreover, it also 
allows long -term monitoring of horses after ALDDFT removal. This is particularly relevant with 
cell or implant therapies often associated with tumorigenesis,281 that can also be systemic su ch as 
implant -associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma.282  
4.4.3. Objective Gait Analysis  
 Clinical presentation of the model developed in this study showed temporal impairment of 
limb use for up to 7 weeks post -operatively  as similar to that of naturally -occurring ALDDFT 
injuries. In naturally -occurring ALD DFT or SDFT injuries, lameness is often subjectively absent 
or mild, although swelling of metacarpal region is a consistent findings.283 In this study, limb use 
was evaluated objectively using GRF measurement to detect mild lameness, as any decrease in 
PVF is associated with incr eased pain in that limb of horse.284 As a result, transient limb use 
impairment observed in this study was longer than that previously reported in SDFT surgical core 
lesion for up to 2 weeks post -operatively using subjective lamen ess assessment.46 Potential reason 
for longer limb use impairment was due to higher sensitivity of objective gait analysis than 
subjective lameness evalua tion. This was also evident in a study that reported significant decrease 
in PVF after LPS injection into equine joint, despite subjective lameness scores indicated no 
impaired limb use.284 Since 9 weeks post -injury, horses returned to original performance level, 
which was consistent with normal clinical presentation of horses both after ALDDFT injury or 
excision. For example, d esmotomy of ALDDFT has been traditionally performed to treat flexural 
deformity of lower extremity and is known to cause minimum effects on to limb use.285 Thus, n ot 
only similar clinical presentation of the model developed in this study can recapitulate natural 189 
 course of response to injury and treatment, but also minimally invasive injury is advantageous due 
to less medication is required to control post -operative pain that might affect outcomes of testing 
treatment.  
4.4.4. Ultrasound Analysis  
 Ultrasonographically, c ore lesion was identified as hypoechoic area in the center of 
ALDDFT that maintained circ ular- to oval -shape transversely and contained short fibers 
longitudinally. These characteristics were consistent with those of naturally -occurring 
tendon/ligament injury in both horse and human, since  reduction of echogenicity and disruption of 
linear fib ers are criteria of tendon/ligament injury for both species .286 As expected, core lesion 
created in the present study  also resembled ultrasonographic presentation of surgically -induced 
SDFT core lesion.240 Compa red to naturally -occurring ALDDFT desmitis, ultrasonographic 
presentation of core lesion created in this study may represent approximately half of clinical cases, 
as the other half was presented as diffusely hypoechoic ligament.283 Morphologically, s urgically -
induced core lesion in the present study had relatively uniform lesion size and echogenicity  clearly 
distinguishable  from normal tissue. On the contrary, chemically -induced lesion tends to lead to  
non-homogenous size, morphology, and echogenicity .287 This is an important advantage of 
surgically -induced core lesion for both limiting variations and clinical assessment,  because the 
lesion size evaluation is an essential part of tendon/ligament healing due to association with local 
pain in equine.41 In the present study, the lesion CSA increased transiently by 5 week post -injury 
and gradually decreased, w hile echogenicity of lesion increased overtime. Th is was consistent with 
same trend s observed  in both chemically and surgically induced SDFT core lesion.41,43,50 Of note 
is that several factors have effects on core lesion size. For example , the transient increase of lesion 
CSA and associated pain was reported  only after MSCs treatment in a study  of surgically -induced 190 
 equine SDFT core lesion .41 Hence, it is possible ASCs treatment administered in the present study 
might have contributed to the lesion CSA increase in one of the horses. Additionally, w hen 
measuring lesion CSA, it is  important to consider post -injury management, since surgically 
induced SDFT core lesion CSA varies between bandaging or casting.288 Therefore, it is important 
also to administer a consistent post -injury management to all horses throughout the study period 
to minimize variation.  
 In human, tendon/ligament lesion often presents itself as diffuse hypoechoic area rather 
than confined ce ntral core lesion . Therefore , CSA of injured tendon or ligament itself rather than 
lesion CSA is used for evaluation. Indeed, increased tendon/ligament CSA is a common change 
associated with injury  in human , which leads to decreased mechanical properties a nd decreased 
functionality.289,290 Clinically, tendon/ligament CS A increases gradually over 12 weeks after injury 
in human, and CSA is an important early healing phase that affect long -term recovery.291 The same 
measure is applicable to our ALDDFT core lesion model as well, since overall ligament CSA 
subjectively increased overtime and accompanied by persistent swelling of limb circumference at  
the surgical site throughout the study period. This was consistent with previous reports of surgical 
and chemical SDFT core lesion model where increased tendon/ligament CSA persisted as long as 
6 months post -injury.29,30,46 Tendon CSA increase upon injury can be replicated also in small 
animals such as rabbit,292 yet evaluation of ultrasonographic images is much less established than 
that in horse. Therefore, our ALDDFT core lesion model closely recapitulates not only equine 
tendon/ligament  core lesion s but also share characteristics with human tendon/ligament injury 
ultrasonographically.  
 Core lesion created in the present study gained echogenicity over 3 months post -injury 
period. This is consistent with naturally -occurring tendon injury that regains ech ogenicity over 191 
 several months period.293 Prolonged presence of hypoechoic core lesion despite of earlier clinical 
improvement observed in the present study was also consistent with naturally -occurring 
tendon/ligament injury.283 In terms of the period to regain original echogenicity, our ALDDFT 
model is close  to naturally -occurring ALDDFT desmitis, since it was reported half of the horses 
had normal appearance of ALDDFT ultrasonographically after 4 months from initial injury.283 
Another important property of ALDDFT core lesion established in the present study is the lack of 
lesion pr opagation into DDFT, since it can introduc e a confounding factor . This was the case for  
surgically -induced SDFT , propagat ing itself vertically and increase d its lesion length  overtime.288 
Regardless of tendon/ligament types, t he limitation of surgical core lesion may be the creation of 
cylindrical empty space ins ide tendon, not truly recapitulating pathologic changes of naturally -
occurring injuries. For example, hypoechoic core lesion of naturally -occurring tendon/ligament 
injury is often characterized by hemorrhag e and effusion .293 Yet, same limitation can be considered 
an unique advantage, since empty core lesion creates partial defect that can test regenerative 
capacity of implants such as hydrogel.294-296  
4.4.5. Microst ructure  
 Macrostructurally, part of core lesion that was not filled with COLI was characterized with 
void space  and necrotic surrounding area. Microstructurally, necrotic area surrounding void core 
lesion contained degrading short ECM fibers and fewer roun d to rhomboid cell infiltration, 
representing transitional phase between inflammatory and proliferative stages of healing. 
Similarly, lesion that received ASCs administration remained voi d, although the surrounding area 
was not necrotic. Therefore, ALDDFT core lesion created in the present study likely to have 
established critical -sized defect (CSD), a n essential criteria to establish in each musculoskeletal 
tissue defect model to delineate  treatment effects from spontaneous healing.297 Establishment of 192 
 CSD in equine ligament is a significant achievement for tendon/ligament regeneration strategies, 
since it evaluates regene rative capacities of interventions to treat large defects that are otherwise 
incurable.298-301 To date, non -critical -sized p artial defect such as central window defect , punch 
biopsy defect , or complete resection models have been created in small animals such as rat and 
rabbit or large animals such as dog or sheep.302,303 In this regard , creation of CSD in equine 
ligament is novel and establishes a foundation for testing of truly regenerative therapeutics. The 
potential reason for remained core lesion without being filled with COLI or neotendon  in equine 
ligament in contrast to small animal s’ tendon/ligament may be robust regenerative capacities of 
small animals th at are not always  represent ative to  those of human.126,304 Interestingly, c reation of 
CSD has not been reported for  surgically -induc ed equine SDFT core lesion,30,46 potentially due to 
the use of cutter to remove tendon tissue in the present st udy rather than burr to simply disrupt 
tissue in most of previous reports. This also may relate to slower healing of ALDDFT core lesion 
in the present study compared to naturally -occurring SDFT injury that can reach remodeling phase 
by 3 months post -injury .305  
 In contrast to empty core lesion area , the are a filled with COLI had non -necrotic 
surrounding area that was  characterized with white and firm scar tissue -like gross appearance . 
Microscopically, enormous round to oval cells infiltrated and randomly aligned inside implanted 
COLI, and surrounding area was characterized with less organized ECM . The amount of ECM 
within COLI implant was rather scares and small amount of fibrous ECMs separated cells within 
densely populated COLI implant. Although mononuclear cell infiltration, giant cell, or signs of 
granulomatous inflammation were not observed inside or surrounding area of implanted COLI, 
cells with eosinophilic granules were found inside COLI, indicating potential immune response. 
Infilt ration of round to oval fibroblastic cells into both synthetic and organic scaffolds used for 193 
 tendon repair augmentation is a commonly observed outcome in human.306 In particular, COLI 
was used in primary repair augmentation of rotator cuff tendon in h uman, and it formed premature 
tendon -like tissue over repair site without rejection in 3 to 6 months post -operatively.214,307 On the 
contrary, the presence of eosinophilic cells inside COLI was noted in the current study. Eosinophil 
accumulation is a prominent feature of multiple allergic diseases in horse.308 With regards to 
immune response to implants, accumulatio n of eosinophil around implant is a common signs of 
reaction to some metal implants.309-311 Therefore, our finding indicated horse may be more 
sensitive to foreign body than human, and the model developed in the present study is an ideal pre -
clinical animal model for investigation of immunogenicity associated with implants.  
 The morphology of implanted neotendon  was similar to that of implanted COLI. It was 
populated by numerous cells with oval to oblong nucleus. The cells, however, attained better 
parallel alignment with longitudinal axis of ALDDFT subjectively. Moreover, the re appeared to 
have better integration of implanted neotendon  to surrounding native tissue, since the cellular 
alignment was more organized at peripheral area of implanted ligament than central region and 
there was more extensive communication of ECM fiber s between neotendon  implant and 
surrounding native tissue. Interestingly, there was an area of apparent chondrogenic differentiation 
of endogenous cells in surrounding area of neotendon  potentially as a form of aberrant healing 
response. This was often com mon healing response to tendon/ligament injuries, since granulation 
tissue that form after natural injury often contains ectopic chondroid and largely fibrotic.293 In 
terms of immune response to neotendon , the signs observed were largely similar to those observed 
for COLI implant, inc luding lack of mononuclear cell infiltration or giant cell, lack of fibrotic 
capsule formation around implant, yet there was presence of eosinophilic cells within implant. 
Subjectively, however, there appeared to have been less eosinophilic cells within neotendon  194 
 compared to COLI implant.  Of note was surrounding areas of both implanted  COLI and neotendon  
as well as that of core lesion treated by ASCs were non -necrotic . The potential reason for this 
finding is cells, potentially MSCs, that infiltrated COLI or those cultured in neotendon  as well as 
ASCs injected into the core lesion might have exerted anti -necrotic paracrine effects, as MSCs 
have anti -necrotic effects to treat osteonecrosis.312-314 ASCs are also reported to improve structural 
organization of chemically -induced SDFT core lesion,51 which might hav e contributed to the lack 
of necrotic surrounding area .  
4.5. Conclusion  
 Surgically -induced equine ALDDFT core lesion model established in the present study 
presents a novel non -terminal equine ligament injury model that closely resemble s naturally -
occurring equine tendon/ligament injuries  both clinically and etiopathologically . It is characterized 
with mild and transient limb use impairment as well as ultrasonographic hypoechoic lesion that 
follows size , morphology,  and echogenicity chang es typically seen in naturally -occurring injuries . 
Additionally, core lesion does not heal without any intervention  and leads to void space surrounded 
by largely necrotic tissue,  demonstrat ing robust testing capability of regenerative therapies. 
Collective ly, the model is an effective mechanism with improved accessibility that facilitate s 
clinical translation of novel tendon/ligament treatment strategies.
