Title: Lens Regeneration: The Application of iSyTE and In Silico Approaches to Evaluate Gene Expression in Lens Organoids.
Abstract: Several protocols have been established for the generation of lens organoids from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and other cells with regenerative potential in humans or various animal models. It is important to examine how well the regenerated lens organoids reflect lens biology, in terms of its development, homeostasis, and aging. Toward this goal, the iSyTE database (integrated Systems Tool for Eye gene discovery; https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/iSyTE/ ), a bioinformatics resource tool that contains meta-analyzed gene expression data in wild-type lens across different embryonic, postnatal, and adult stages, can serve as a resource for comparative analysis. This article outlines the approaches toward effective use of iSyTE to gain insights into normal gene expression in the mouse lens, enriched expression in the lens, and differential gene expression in select mouse gene-perturbation cataract/lens defects models, which in turn can be used to evaluate expression of key lens-relevant genes in lens organoids by transcriptomics (e.g., RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), microarrays, etc.) or other downstream methods (e.g., RT-qPCR, etc.).
