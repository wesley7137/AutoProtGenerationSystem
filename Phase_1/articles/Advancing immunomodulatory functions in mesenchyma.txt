Title: Advancing immunomodulatory functions in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells through targeting the GATA6-mediated pathway.
Abstract: The immunomodulatory capacity of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) is a key feature that makes them particularly valuable for regenerative medicine. However, this potential is affected by the chronological aging of the donors and the cell expansion procedures in culture. We have demonstrated that GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) plays a pivotal role in the aging of MSCs and inhibiting GATA6 rejuvenates the characteristics of MSCs.
