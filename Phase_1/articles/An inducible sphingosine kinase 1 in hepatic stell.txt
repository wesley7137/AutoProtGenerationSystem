Title: An inducible sphingosine kinase 1 in hepatic stellate cells potentiates liver fibrosis.
Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a role in hepatic fibrosis and sphingosine kinase (SphK) is involved in biological processes. As studies on the regulatory mechanisms and functions of SphK in HSCs during liver fibrosis are currently limited, this study aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism and connected pathways of SphK upon HSC activation. The expression of SphK1 was higher in HSCs than in hepatocytes, and upregulated in activated primary HSCs. SphK1 was also increased in liver homogenates of carbon tetrachloride-treated or bile duct ligated mice and in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-treated LX-2 cells. TGF-β-mediated SphK1 induction was due to Smad3 signaling in LX-2 cells. SphK1 modulation altered the expression of liver fibrogenesis-related genes. This SphK1-mediated profibrogenic effect was dependent on SphK1/sphingosine-1-phosphate/sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor signaling through ERK. EGCG blocked TGF-β-induced SphK1 expression and hepatic fibrogenesis by attenuating Smad and MAPK activation. SphK1 induced by TGF-β facilitates HSC activation and liver fibrogenesis, which is reversed by EGCG. Accordingly, SphK1 and related signal transduction may be utilized to treat liver fibrosis.
