1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Life exists at the interface of numerous molecular,  chemical, and physical processes, and as part of t his precarious 
balance, life must both exploit and overcome variou s features of these phenomena. One of the most impo rtant 
physical processes that both defines and limits cel lular functions in the human body is that of diffus ion. Evidence 
suggests that diffusion of molecular factors may pl ay vital roles in the self-organization of tissue a rchitecture and 
determination of cellular identity in development, including factors affecting potency, differentiatio n, metabolic state, 
and functions of cells and tissues. Many of these d evelopmental and metabolic processes and signaling pathways 
remain to be studied and elucidated, but the abilit y to mathematically model the role of diffusion pro cesses with 
precise theoretical determinations opens a valuable  and expansive field of mathematical study in stem cell biology, 
developmental biology, tissue engineering, and dise ase modeling.  
 
Recent major advancements in biomaterials and stem cell culture have enabled the construction of compl ex three-
dimensional (3D) multi-cellular organoid tissues. I n some cases, cells are able to self-organize withi n a homogenous 2 
 biomaterial scaffold [1], in some cases the cellula r architecture may be guided by more complex config urations of 
patterned topographical and biochemical cues within  the construct [2], while in other cases cells may be grown into 
aggregate multi-cellular spheroids without the addi tion of biomaterials [3]. These organoid constructs  enable 
incredible new capabilities for researching numerou s biological processes in a controlled in vitro  environment, 
including the study of organ development, stem cell  growth and differentiation, and cell signaling fac tors involved in 
the formation of cellular identity and spatial patt erning. Importantly, these organoid technologies al so open up a vast 
number of clinical applications, including disease modeling, pharmacological and toxicological drug te sting, tumor 
models that direct personalized chemotherapy, and t issue reconstruction for regenerative medicine. How ever, the 
formation of 3D cellular cultures also gives rise t o new complexities in physical diffusion phenomena that are not 
present in more traditional two-dimensional (2D) cu lture systems and which warrant detailed examinatio n.  
 
2. INTERACTIONS OF DIFFUSION PHENOMENA WITH STEM CE LL FUNCTION AND TISSUE DEVELOPMENT 
 
2.1 The Emergence of Diffusion Phenomena in 3D Tiss ue Constructs 
 
With the formation of conglomerate cell cultures an d engineered tissues, new diffusion dynamics arise in the 3D 
constructs. Delivery of nutrients like oxygen, gluc ose, fats, and amino acids to cells in such constru cts is effectively 
more limited, which can critically affect in vitro  tissue development as well as integration of the c onstruct into the 
body after implantation. Diffusion-limited growth a nd inadequate mass transport of nutrients or signal ing factors 
into the deeper or more sequestered regions of the construct tends to decrease cell survival and tissu e size, and 
metabolism of the diffusant further decreases its a vailability and alters its spatial concentration pr ofile through the 
construct [4]. The shape of the concentration gradi ent through a tissue is affected by the local condi tions of the 
system, which is important because the shape of thi s gradient may produce differential downstream cons equences on 
the development of stem cells based on their positi oning within tissues. In addition, concentration gr adients are also 
known to play important roles in axonal guidance, a lthough much remains to be explored on the mechanis ms of how 
such gradients are established at the proper place and time in tissues and how multiple gradients inte ract with each 
other to influence developing cells and tissue arch itecture. Thus modeling these mechanisms helps to u nderstand 
both normal development and may also relate to prev iously unknown mechanisms of certain developmental 
pathologies. 
 
In general, there is a Gaussian-shaped curve throug h unbound space for limited and unmetabolized subst ances 
diffusing through a homogenous medium of any dimens ionality, while an unmetabolized substance in const ant or 
unlimited supply in tissue constructs will generall y produce the shape of a complementary error functi on (erfc) when 
diffusing primarily in one dimension, the shape of a Bessel function of the first kind (order zero) wh en diffusing 
primarily in two dimensions, and the shape of a hyp erbolic curve when diffusing in three dimensions [4 ]. The 3 
 introduction of constant (zero order) metabolism of  the diffusant generally results in a parabolic con centration curve 
in any dimensionality [4]. Multiple different molec ular factors can simultaneously overlap with entire ly different 
concentration gradients depending on the conditions  and characteristics of both the cellular tissue an d each 
molecular factor. The initial concentration of diff usant at the tissue interface ( /g182√/g3042) will proportionally influence the 
concentration values throughout the tissue, while t he diffusion coefficient ( /g1830) has a more complex role, 
proportionally relating the molar flux of diffusant  to the spatial concentration gradient, which, in e ssence, ultimately 
describes how easily a particular diffusant moves t hrough a medium. Diffusion limitations can be parti ally overcome 
through a variety of methods, which include the gen eral approaches of increasing nutrient concentratio ns in 
surrounding fluid, decreasing the diffusion coeffic ient in the construct material (i.e., increasing pe rmeability to 
nutrients), decreasing the diffusion range or depth  of the tissue construct, increasing convective flo w or perfusion of 
nutrient, or decreasing nutrient consumption, and e ach of these approaches has consequences for the ti ssue construct.  
 
Importantly, diffusion limitations can also be desi rable, producing concentration gradients into or ou t of the tissue 
construct that mediate essential developmental proc esses and activate or inhibit vital cell signaling cues. It is known 
that diffusion gradients of numerous morphogenic si gnaling factors play extensive roles in the differe ntiation and 
architectural formation of neural tissue, including , for example, regional gradients of sonic hedgehog  (SHH), wnt 
protein (WNT), bone morphogenic protein (BMP), fibr oblast growth factor (FGF), retinoic acid (RA), and  reelin 
(RELN) [5]. The limited diffusion capacity of bioma terials not only causes decreased concentration of externally-
supplied nutrients within the construct, but also r esults in increased internal concentrations of endo genous factors 
secreted by cells. This property of biomaterials en ables endogenous signaling factors to form local re gions of 
concentration gradients similar to what occurs in e ndogenous developing tissue, and this property like ly provides 
essential self-organization capabilities of cells i n 3D organoid constructs over standard 2D cultures under the same 
culture conditions. Thus, several analytic models a re presented herein, including equations for both i nward and 
outward diffusion, to describe diffusant behaviors and consequences in various 3D tissue constructs, a s summarized 
in Figure 1.

scenarios are provided, including for limited or un limited diffusants, diffusion into or out of the ti ssue, with or without metabolism of the 
diffusant, and in constructs of slabs (1D – bottom row), cylinders (2D – middle row), or spheres (3D –  top row). 
 
 
2.2 The Influence of Diffusing Factors on Cell Sign aling Pathways, Metabolism, and Potency State 
 
Although much remains to be learned regarding the r ole of diffusing nutrients in tissue development, i t has recently 
become apparent that metabolic dynamics and nutrien t supply can control epigenetic configurations of s tem cells, 
and reciprocally, epigenetic networks control energ etic processes and metabolic preferences in the cel l. Moreover, 
these effects can play a significant role in stem c ell potency, differentiation, and fundamental progr ammed processes 
in tissue development. Evidence suggests that the m etabolic activity of a cell is actively modified by  many of the 
same epigenetic reconfigurations that occur through  changing states of stem cell potency and different iation, and in 
general, while mature cells tend to favor the effic iency of oxidative metabolism, pluripotent stem cel ls (PSCs) tend to 
favor a glycolytic state [6]. Many other types of s tem cells, including neural stem cells (NSCs), also  favor anaerobic 
glycolytic metabolism [7,8] while mature neurons fa vor oxidative metabolism [9,10]. The oxidative pref erence of 
adult somatic cells is converted to a glycolytic pr eference early in reprogramming to a pluripotent st ate [11,12,13], 
and this may be related to the observation that gly colysis is also favored by malignantly-transformed cells, which 
resemble stem cells in their self-renewal and abili ty to endure hypoxic environments [14,15,16]. In ca ncer cells, this 
shift in metabolism from aerobic to anaerobic appea rs to be actively instigated by mutated genes like tumor 
suppressor protein p53 ( TP53)  and its downstream targets [17,18]. Similarly, in both embryonic and induced stem 
cells, these metabolic preferences are not merely p assive consequences, but are in fact requisite in m aintaining the 
5 
 pluripotent state and in reprogramming mature cells  to a pluripotent state, and differentiation of plu ripotent cells can 
be impeded unless these glycolytic processes switch  to an oxidative metabolism [19,20,21].  
 
Expression of several glycolytic enzymes is upregul ated under conditions of hypoxia [16,22]. It is tho ught that the 
preferred glycolytic state of stem cells or cancer cells may serve to protect them from reactive oxyge n species (ROS)—
glycolysis enables the pentose phosphate pathway to  produce the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which keeps glutath ione in a reduced state (GSH) for antioxidant prote ction [17]. 
Exposure of adult stem cells to ROS has been noted to prompt quiescent adult stem cells, including hem atopoietic 
stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a nd neural stem cells (NSCs), out of quiescence and into 
proliferation [8], and exposure to ROS can also aff ect cell fate decisions [23,24]. Antioxidants like vitamin C can help 
reverse cell senescence and aid changes in epigenet ic expression during reprogramming of induced pluri potent stem 
cells (iPSCs) [25]. The influence of a stem cell’s energy status and mitochondrial function on its pot ency state may 
also explain why supplementation with electron-carr ier coenzymes like NAD + precursor nicotinamide riboside has 
been found to rejuvenate neural and muscle stem cel ls [26]. In addition, despite less efficient energy  production than 
oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and the pento se phosphate pathway also enable improved anabolic nutrient 
production for cell proliferation, including the sy nthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids [27 ].    
 
Several sensors of energy usage and nutrient availa bility exist in the cell, including adenosine monop hosphate-
activated kinase (AMPK) and the mammalian target of  rapamycin complex (mTORC). As adenosine triphospha te 
(ATP) energy is used, AMPK becomes activated by pho sphorylation in order to inhibit anabolic processes  that 
consume ATP and to activate catabolic processes tha t replenish ATP. Similarly, a low supply of amino a cids will 
attenuate mTORC activity, which lowers anabolic act ivity in the cell. Under normoxic conditions, the 1 4-3-3 protein 
inhibits the tuberous sclerosis 2 protein (TSC-2), preventing expected inhibition of mTORC by the tube rous sclerosis 
protein 1/2 (TSC-1/2) complex. Hypoxia, however, up regulates REDD1 protein, which inhibits binding of the 14-3-3 
protein to the TSC-1/2 complex, thereby enabling in hibition of mTORC [8,28]. Activated AMPK (whether f rom low 
glucose or oxygen supply or from high energy usage that exceeds energy supply) can inhibit mTORC activ ity, 
thereby inhibiting protein production. Interestingl y, reprogramming to pluripotency decreases mTORC ac tivity, 
likely due to the fact that Sox2 represses mTORC ex pression [29]. Moreover, activation of mTORC (e.g.,  by deletion of 
TSC-2 ) inhibits reprogramming to pluripotency, while inh ibition of mTORC (e.g., with rapamycin) enhances 
reprogramming to a pluripotent state, and the inhib ition of mTORC has also been shown to help maintain  the 
population of stem cells and to suppress the produc tion of ROS [8,30]. It should also be noted, howeve r, that mTORC 
inhibition and AMPK activation can disrupt expressi on of Oct4, Sox2, or Nanog and drive differentiatio n of certain 
germ layer lineages [6,31,32]. Hypoxia can also lea d to changes in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity  and histone 
phosphorylation via AMPK [33,34], both of which alt er gene expression, as summarized in Figure 2.  
 6 
  
Figure 2: Diagram of Nutrient Diffusion and Stem Ce ll Signaling. The effects of various nutrient diffu sants involved in energy production and 
metabolism are shown to also influence stem cell st ates and cellular differentiation.  
 
The multipotency of neural stem/progenitor cells is  also generally preserved by a hypoxic environment,  including 
both physiologic hypoxia (2-3%) and more severe hyp oxia that would likely otherwise threaten viability  of mature 
neuronal cells [8,35,36]. Many types of endogenous stem cells are known to reside in a hypoxic niche, including 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stem c ells (MSCs), and neural stem cells (NSCs), which pr eserves 
tissue-specific endogenous stem cell populations [3 7]. Metabolic processes are also tightly coupled wi th the balance 
of stem cell populations in many types of tissues, and forced over-activation of mTORC (e.g., by delet ion or 
inhibition of mTORC-inhibitors or constitutive expr ession of mTORC-activators) is known to shorten and  accelerate 
the cell cycle in NSCs and HSCs [8], which, dependi ng on the context and conditions, can diminish the repopulation 
capacity of HSCs or expand the proliferative capaci ty of NSCs [30,38]. Also, Lin28, acting through the  PI3K-mTORC 
pathway, has been shown to accelerate cell prolifer ation in mouse PSCs [39]. 
 
In human PSCs, much evidence suggests that hypoxia tends to promote and preserve the pluripotent state , both 
preventing differentiation and enhancing reprogramm ing efficiency [15,19,31,34,40]. In fact, hypoxia h as been shown 
to induce expression of many of the same genes used  as reprogramming factors for pluripotency, includi ng OCT4 , 
SOX2 , KLF4 , NANOG , MYC , and LIN28  [15,41]. Because the choice of reprogramming facto rs substantially influences 
the quality and developmental potential of reprogra mmed stem cells [42], environmental conditions of g asses, 
nutrients, and signaling factors will also influenc e these qualities, all of which are mediated by dif fusion processes.  
 
7 
 At greater distances from energy and nutrient sourc es where lower levels of nutrients will exist in th e tissue due to 
diffusion limitations, cell pathways that favor plu ripotent states are thus more likely to be active. This has an 
interesting correlate in cerebral organoids, where cortical neuron precursors migrate to and terminall y differentiate at 
the external rim of the construct nearest the envir onmental oxygen supply, while deeper into the const ruct where 
oxygen is much more limited, neural stem cells may be better preserved and expand to supply future neu ral 
populations that fill the cortex. As organoid spher es expand, the hypoxic gradient can alter the posit ion, timing, and 
fate of stem cells within the organoid and can also  threaten cell viability. Diffusion modeling using Eq. 9 for oxygen & 
Eq. 12 for glucose has shown that central hypoxia in stem-cell-derived  organoids is the main factor in limiting their 
maximal size and causing a central necrotic core if  they grow beyond the limits of oxygen diffusion an d metabolic 
consumption, though glucose could also become a lim iting factor if feeding media is not replenished fr equently 
enough [4].  
 
Environmental availability of oxygen is known to re gulate sets of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), an d HIFs regulate 
the expression of many genes involved in stem cell state, cellular development, and metabolic function s. At normal 
atmospheric oxygen concentration and pressure, oxyg en induces hydroxylation and ubiquitinization of HI Fs by 
prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) and the von-Hippel-Linda u protein (pVHL), respectively, which then targets α-subunits 
of HIFs for proteosomal degradation; with exposure to hypoxia, however, the α-subunits of HIFs are sta bilized and 
bind to their respective nuclear translocators (e.g ., HIF1β and HIF2β), where, in the nucleus, the HIF s then bind to 
various hypoxia-response elements for transcription al regulation [43]. Similarly, enzymes like JmjC hi stone lysine 
demethylase (KDMs) are sensitive to specific oxygen  concentrations and influence epigenetic regulation  of the cell 
[44]. Both HIF1α and HIF2α are required for reprogr amming to pluripotency, and the activity of either one alone 
activates the accompanying metabolic change to anae robic glycolysis, although HIF2α activity in the la te stages of 
reprogramming can inhibit the reprogramming process  [12].  
 
Although ESCs and iPSCs are both pluripotent stem c ells with equivalent functional potential and only minor 
epigenetic differences between them [45], further s ub-states of pluripotency have emerged, including t he concept of 
naïve versus primed pluripotent states. The naïve s tate tends to prefer oxidative metabolism (but util izes both 
glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation) and seems  to represent the earliest state of embryonic devel opment before 
implantation into the womb, while the primed plurip otent state favors glycolytic energy production and  represents a 
more mature post-implantation state where DNA methy lation patterns have already undergone significant changes 
[46,47]. Pluripotent cells can be coaxed into eithe r state with various intrinsic and extrinsic factor s [48,49]. Among the 
factors that promote a naïve state are the expressi on of Nanog and Klf4, both of which are promoted by  hypoxia 
(Figure 2), again suggesting that a low oxygen envi ronment likely favors the naïve pluripotent state, although it is 
not known if this alone can be sufficient to induce  or maintain such a state in certain cells.  
 8 
 Hypoxia also activates other genes associated with stem cell states and cell development, including ex pression of 
Notch, WNT, and SHH, all via HIF1α [50,51] (Figure 2). It is not yet clear whether the mechanism of mo dulation of 
some hypoxia-responsive genes (like MYC , NANOG , or KLF4 ) is mediated directly by HIFs or other signaling 
pathways, but evidence suggests that some of these genes are regulated at least in part by non-coding microRNAs 
(miRNA). For example, MYC  can be regulated by miRNA-210, which itself is con trolled by both HIF1α and 2α [52], 
and Lin28 RNA-binding proteins inhibit let-7 miRNAs  (which normally act as tumor suppressors), with th e result 
that Lin28 and let-7 act as mutually antagonistic r egulators of several downstream processes including  glycolytic 
metabolism and cell growth via an mTORC-dependent p athway [53]. 
 
Several of the above factors are also involved in t he early development of regional identity of neural  tissue, including 
SHH, which generally drives ventralization, and WNT , which generally drives caudalization and dorsaliz ation [5]. 
WNT and SHH activities are both increased under hyp oxia via HIF1α, and both the WNT and SHH signaling 
pathways act through the β-catenin transducer, whic h activates effectors like FGF and Noggin to inhibi t SMAD 
signaling pathways, as shown in Figure 3. SMAD inhi bition is often used in directing differentiation o f stem cells to a 
neuronal fate, which is typically done in culture w ith small molecule inhibitors of BMP and TGF-β that  result in 
SMAD4-inhibition [54]. BMP and TGF-β can also activ ate Notch via SMAD1, as can hypoxia itself via HIF1 α-
mediated signals [55], and TGF-β and SMAD4 can also  exhibit reciprocal inhibition with MYC [56].  
 
 
Figure 3: Diagram of Diffusible Stem Cell Different iation Signals. An overview is shown for how severa l signaling pathways can be used to 
guide differentiation from pluripotency to neurogli al lineage. Interestingly, many of the factors used  in directed differentiation modulate the same 
molecular pathways used in oxygen signaling.  
 
Further evidence also shows that specific oxygen le vels can have differential effects on germ layer sp ecification and 
subsequent cell fate decisions, including whether n eural progenitors progress to neurons or glia, depe nding on 
conditions and context that remain to be fully defi ned [41,57,58]. Exposure of spheroid cultures of hu man PSCs to 
9 
 transient hypoxia (2% vs 21% O 2), for example, was shown to drive a neural lineage  over that of cardiovascular or 
musculoskeletal lineages and to change neuronal cel l fate to a glial cell fate by acting through HIF1α  to inhibit Lin28 
expression [41]. Other work, however, has shown tha t inhibition of mTORC limits pluripotency and proli feration 
while enhancing differentiation of human PSCs towar ds endodermal and mesodermal lineages [32]. Differe ntiation 
of neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) under hypoxic co nditions (1-5% O 2) has been shown to greatly expand and alter 
the possible array of mature neural subtypes, and a ctivation of Notch signaling can promote maintenanc e of the 
neural precursor population and fate [55]. Physiolo gic hypoxia (2-3% O 2) has also been found to promote 
neurogenesis while severe hypoxia (<1% O 2) impeded both neurogenesis and gliogenesis [59]. 
 
Nitric oxide (NO) is another diffusible gas in tiss ues, which in the brain is produced by neural cells , glial cells, and 
vascular endothelial cells, both by constitutive an d inducible mechanisms, particularly in response to  ischemia in 
stroke, septic shock, or other poor perfusion event s via various NO-synthase (NOS) isoforms as well as  by other 
NOS-independent mechanisms [60,61]. NO can inhibit mitochondrial respiration and upregulate glycolysis  and 
shunting through the pentose phosphate pathway, whi ch may provide neuroprotection against free radical  toxicity, 
mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis [61,62]. Howeve r, the production of NO in response to hypoxia or i schemia 
appears to depend on the particular conditions and timing of oxygen deprivation and reperfusion, and N O may play 
either protective or toxic roles depending on local  conditions and tissue cell types, with neuroglial- produced NO 
playing a possible neurotoxic role while endothelia l-produced NO may play a protective role by enhanci ng vascular 
perfusion. Consequently, both NO and NO-suppression  have been suggested as therapeutic interventions f or 
ischemic conditions in tissues of the brain and hea rt. Similarly, another gas affecting stem cell surv ival and 
differentiation is carbon dioxide (CO 2), with evidence that higher levels of CO 2 (10% versus the standard 5%) enabled 
the formation of larger and higher-quality neurosph eres, induced significantly greater Nestin, Pax6, S ox2, and Foxg1 
expression in neuroprogenitor populations, and faci litated the genesis of glutamatergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, 
and GABAergic neuronal subtypes [63]. Importantly, these data provide further evidence that cell popul ations in 3D 
tissue cultures are influenced not just by inward d iffusion of outside nutrients, but also by factors diffusing 
outwardly from inside the tissue construct. 
 
Local variations in gas and nutrients within a tiss ue construct can therefore induce significant varia tions in cell and 
tissue identity, although it remains unknown to wha t extent the microenvironment of diffusant substanc es can 
regulate and guide essential developmental processe s and cell states in the many different tissues of the human body. 
The effects of hypoxia on differentiation likely de pend substantially not just on the exact amount of ambient oxygen 
or nutrient but also on genetic networks that are a ctive or inactive in the cell and the phase of diff erentiation and cell 
maturity. A better understanding of oxygen concentr ations within 3D cell cultures along with careful a nalysis of 
intermediate states of differentiation and developm ent will thus help delineate the interactions of co mplex signaling 
cues and help resolve conflicting results.  10 
 2.3 The Influence of Nutrient Signaling and Metabol ism on Neurological Disease 
 
Several factors involved in hypoxia signaling pathw ays are also known to play critical roles in neurol ogical 
development and disease. For example, the tuberous sclerosis protein (TSC) complex, which acts as a tu mor 
suppressor and, when mutated, causes the condition of tuberous sclerosis, acts to inhibit the mTOR com plex, but is 
itself normally inhibited under normoxia. Subependy mal nodules and giant cell astrocytomas associated with 
tuberous sclerosis are thought to be due to abnorma l proliferation and migration of neural stem/progen itor cells 
(NSPCs) [64], and recent clinical trials show these  types of tumors, and potentially others like gliob lastoma and 
medulloblastoma, may be treated with mTORC-inhibito rs like sirolimus, everolimus, dactolisib, XL765, o r INK128 
[65,66]. Similarly, neurofibromatosis 1 is caused b y disruption of the Ras-effector pathway which in t urn can act 
through the TSC complex to exert its effects on mTO RC, and the optic gliomas associated with this cond ition may 
also benefit from mTORC-inhibitors [67]. Moreover, mutations in pVHL cause von Hippel Lindau syndrome,  with a 
constellation of tumors, vascular malformations, an d cysts. Mutations or disruptions of SHH, or its do wnstream 
effector Patched1, can result in holoprosencephaly and craniofacial abnormalities. Metabolic impairmen ts of 
mitochondrial function and susceptibility to oxidat ive stress are also suspected to play a major role in the 
pathogenesis of Parkinson’s diseases via mutant LRR K2, PARK2, PINK1, or Miro proteins [68]. 
 
Hypoxia is also known to inhibit numerous other sig naling factors relevant to vascular development, ce ll migration, 
and tumor growth, including VEGF, EPO, and matrix m etalloproteinase activity [51,69,70], and, as is se en in Figures 
2 and 3, many of these pathways overlap and interse ct with each other. The mechanisms whereby the mito chondrial, 
nuclear, and cytoplasmic signaling work together (in cluding causes and effects) to dictate metabolic pr eferences, 
energy production, oxidative protection, potency pr eservation, and cell fates still remains to be eluc idated. Because 
metabolic functions and mitochondrial activity play  essential roles in maintenance of and differentiat ion from stem 
cell states [71] researchers are obliged to be awar e of difficulties that may arise in accurately mode ling or restoring 
metabolic and mitochondrial diseases with patient-a ffected iPSCs compared with normal iPSCs.  
 
Pathological hypoxia in development is linked to se veral intractable neurological conditions, includin g 
encephalopathy, epilepsy, and cognitive impairments . Interestingly, however, exposure of many types of  adult cells, 
including neurons and cardiomyocytes, to sub-lethal  intervals of hypoxia can also enable cells to surv ive subsequent 
insults of more severe hypoxia, a phenomenon known as preconditioning, which may have implications for  
protecting organs and tissue from hypoxic-ischemic events [72]. The proper contexts and molecular mech anisms of 
this protective conditioning effect are still being  fully elucidated [73], but this phenomenon may be useful for helping 
therapeutic cells and synthetic tissues survive aft er implantation into the body since the survival of  these implanted 
tissues prior to vascularized integration is depend ent on diffusion of nutrients from surrounding tiss ues. The 11 
 influence of gas and nutrient concentrations on gen e expression and cell signaling pathways will also have many 
consequences for 3D tissue culture protocols and me dia formulations.  
 
Altogether, the collection of evidence shows that di ffusant signaling is a crucial factor in all stem c ell function, 
particularly for neural tissue development, and the refore an understanding of diffusion properties and  profiles in 
tissue is essential to the study of tissue developm ent. The ability of specific levels of gas, nutrien ts, and signaling 
factors to influence states of potency and differen tiation means that diffusion can have significant e ffects on the 
composition, shape, and function of various tissues  throughout the body. The rate and timing of stem c ell self-
renewal, quiescence, and differentiation will tight ly influence the size and capacity of the endogenou s stem cell 
population in adult tissues and will also influence  the quantity, balance, structure, and function of more specific cell 
identities in synthetic tissues. The mechanisms tha t regulate and carry out these functions, however, a re not yet well 
understood despite the fact that they exert tremend ous influence over numerous developmental and physi ological 
processes.  
 
3. MODELS OF DIFFUSION IN TISSUE CONSTRUCTS 
 
The represented constants and variables for the fol lowing models are listed in the nomenclature summar y (Table 1). 
In order to enable exact mapping of physical nutrie nt gradients through a 3D tissue construct at any g iven point in 
time, diffusion models were derived from the diffus ion equation given by Fick’s laws, as applied to ti ssue constructs 
in the shape of a rectangular slab (s=1), a cylinde r (s=2), or a sphere (s=3), and with a homogenous m etabolic 
consumption rate of /g2030:

Analytic solutions describing diffusion of substanc es into 3D tissue constructs were recently describe d by the author, 
including novel models for diffusant substances tha t are metabolized by cells in the tissue construct (e.g., nutrients 
like glucose and oxygen) and for diffusants that ar e not metabolized by cells (e.g., certain cell sign aling factors) as 
well as for both limited and unlimited diffusants ( like glucose and oxygen, respectively), as summariz ed in Table 2. 
Approaches for finding various solutions to the dif fusion equation and creating applicable models have  been 
described by many authors [74,75,76,77], which is d iscussed in more detail in reference [4]. Equations  describing 
outward diffusion from a tissue construct (e.g., fo r diffusing factors that are produced by or embedde d in the tissue 
construct) can be derived in a similar manner with altered boundary conditions, the solutions of which  are also 
presented in Table 2 as Eqs. 1-3. Typical values fo r diffusion parameters can be found in Table 3, and  complete 
descriptions of boundary conditions and parameters for operating these models can be found in Table 5 and in 
reference [4].

 Because of difficulty in measuring gas or nutrient gradients through small, metabolically-active spher es, 
mathematical models provide a means for estimating diffusion gradients based on known diffusion mechan ics and a 
few basic assumptions. The models are valid under t he assumptions that cells are homogenously distribu ted and 
diffusivity is isotropic in the tissue construct, t hat diffusion occurs primarily along a single axis through a slab (1D 
case) or along the radial axis of a cylinder or sph ere (2D or 3D cases), and, for the metabolic cases,  that consumption 
rates of the diffusant (represented by /g2030) are constant in the construct during each modeled  time interval. In the case 
of slab constructs, the surface of the construct is  at /g187, = 0  and the thickness of the construct is represented by /g187, = /g184, , 
whereas the surface of the radial constructs is at /g1870 = /g1844  and the center at /g1870 = 0 , and solutions to the models are valid 
within the domain of 0 < /g187, <	/g184, /g3040/g3028/g3051  or 0 < /g1870 < /g1844 /g3040/g3028/g3051 . In models of outward diffusion, /g182√/g3042 is the concentration of 
substance that diffuses from the center of the tiss ue construct, and in models of inward diffusion, /g182√/g3042 is the initial 
concentration of substance at the outer edge of the  tissue construct.  
 
In most cases, the initial concentration in a tissu e construct ( /g182√/g303,) is zero, such as when newly-formed organoids are 
introduced into a media environment of glucose, oxy gen, or other molecular factors, but in cases where  the diffusant 
substance of interest is already present in the bio material, its initial concentration ( /g182√/g303,) is subtracted from the driving 
concentration of /g182√/g3042 and also subtracted from the total concentration /g182√. In other words, “ /g182√/g3042” is replaced with “ (/g182√/g3042−
/g182√/g303,)”) and “ /g182√” is replaced with “( /g182√ − /g182√/g303,)”. In the cases of diffusion out of a tissue const ruct, it is assumed for simplicity 
that the diffusant is diluted to negligible levels once it leaves the tissue construct (e.g., as when the tissue construct 
volume is small relative to the surrounding media).  If this assumption is not made, the diffusion into  the media must 
also be accounted for and the total initial amount of diffusant must be spread over the total volume o f the construct 
and the media at steady state, and the release of d iffusant from the construct will influence its medi a concentration 
and by extension also influence the diffusive drivi ng force over time. 
 
These analytic models thus allow mapping of concent ration gradients through space and time for a varie ty of 
molecular signaling factors and nutrients into or o ut of 3D tissues in the shape of slabs, cylinders, or spheres. Of 
course, many more complex conditions and systems wi ll require more complicated mathematical models tha t 
necessitate numerical approximations with computati onal software rather than complete analytic solutio ns, but this 
serves as an important foundation for mathematical descriptions of diffusion in most general cases of developing 
tissues. Finally, it is also important to note that  actual gradient concentrations could deviate from predicted values 
with varying rates of metabolism, with varying inho mogeneities in the materials or cell densities, or with other 
pertinent forces on the tissue construct or diffusa nt molecules.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
With advancing abilities to create tissue and organ oid structures from stem cells and biomaterials, an d with new and 
ongoing discoveries of how gas, nutrient, and signa ling factor concentrations produce differential eff ects on stem cell 
state and function, a novel role of diffusion model ing has emerged for study of stem cell functions an d 
developmental processes in three-dimensional (3D) t issues. Ideal compositions for formation of targete d tissue 
structures, cellular identities, and functional neu ral networks remain to be explored, and in the cour se of these 
endeavors it is important to recognize that the abi lity to properly guide differentiation of stem cell s and development 
of tissues for therapeutic use is strongly dependen t on how gasses, nutrients, and signaling factors d iffuse in cultured 
tissue constructs. In fact, growth and development of cellular tissues both are influenced by and infl uence the 
internal diffusion dynamics as a reciprocal interac tion. This work describes many complex interactions  of diffusant 
substances in stem cell biology and presents severa l unique analytic models for understanding diffusio n phenomena 
in tissue constructs, thereby enabling modeling of oxygen and nutrient delivery to cells and study of mass transport 
and spatial gradients that form in 3D tissue constr ucts under a variety of conditions. The use of engi neered 
combinations of cells, biomaterials, and biochemica l diffusing factors is likely to one day enable gui ded 
differentiation and detailed control of cellular or ganization in synthetic tissue constructs. These co ncepts and 
investigations will therefore have significant impa ct on regenerative approaches for many otherwise di sparate 
diseases and injuries, particularly those of the ne rvous system, including stroke, spinal cord injury,  cancer, 
neurodegenerative diseases, and many other neurogen etic syndromes and developmental abnormalities.
