With the explosive development  of nanotechnology , multifarious nanomaterials 
emerge quickly. As a typical nanomaterials, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) contain 
iron oxides  compound , cobalt  and nickel  compound , or their dopant compound [1-2]. 
MNPs display their size within  dozens  to hundreds of nanometers  and have a high 
specific surface area . As magnetic materials, MNPs possess the outstanding properties 
of magneti sm, which can be affected  by external magnetic fields.  Generally, MNPs ar e 
synthesized chemically and further decorated by proteins needed [3]. In addition to this , 
some biological magnetic nanoparticles (BMPs) also receives c onsiderable attention s, 
such as magnetosome, a particular kind of Fe3O4 or Fe3S4 nanocrystal covered by 
biological membrane  which is formed by magnetotactic bacteria [4-7].  
Due to versatile  intrinsic properties , MNPs containing magnetosomes have  
promoted challenging  innovations  in biomedical application  through their interplay 
with va rious magnetic fields. In combination with magnetic resonance  imaging, MNPs 
are a fairly effective medical imaging  contrast  agent [8]. MNPs are also used as drug 
carrier [9-10] or in targeted therapy, and designed to be biosensors [9, 11] . As an 
indispensable tool , MNPs play an important role  in those applications. During the 
applications, an external magnetic field is generally required. In addition, MNPs could 
directly induce the cell effects under magnetic fields. For  instance , when exposed in  an 
alternating magnetic field (AMF) MNPs are able to be used in killing tumor cells [12-
14]. Recently, the interaction of MNPs and a magnetic field induced mechanical force 
which is directly applied for the cell regulation [15-16].  
With such issues in mi nd, here in this review, we try to present  a brief summary of  
the cellular effects directly induced by the interaction of MNPs with magnetic fields. 
We describe  the cellular effects of heat induced by MNPs under an alternating magnetic 
field. Besides the h eat effects, this review also addresses the direct effect of mechanical 
force on cell status utilizing MNPs in a magnetic field. Finally, we discuss the cellular 
effects of MNPs under magnetic fields from the point of view of free radicals.  The 
related mec hanisms  behind these cellular effects are simultaneously  elaborate d. 2 Effect of  heat  
When interplaying with an alternating magnetic field, MNPs transform the field 
energy into the heat through the mechanism of magnetic hysteresis , Né el or Brown 
relaxation  and eddy current effect [17-19]. Generally, the temperature induced by the 
technology must increase to 42 º C at least to harm needless  cells [20-21]. The heat 
effect resulted from MNPs in an alternating magnetic field is also called magnetic 
hyperthermia which could be used in biomedical therapy.  
Cancer is an important treatment target of magnetic hyperthermia. E arly magnetic 
hyperthermia simply injected MNPs into the intratumor and recent reviews have 
covered the progress [22-23]. Compared to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the 
traditional magnetic hyperthermia  would not induce the damages of whole body , but 
still cannot realize  targeting to deep lesion location . Targeted magnetic hyperthermia is 
then developed and considered as a more advanced  strategy, where targeted methods 
depend  generally on the receptor -acceptor bind and antigen -antibody reaction. EGF -
tagged MNPs were  first internalized and when exposed to an  AMF  they can result in 
tumor cell death [24-25]. Sanchez C et al also used MNPs decorated with Gastrin  whose 
receptors were overexpressed in several  malignant cancers  to treat Flp-In CCK2R -293 
cells and apoptosis and cell death  were observed under an AMF [26]. Likewise, MNPs 
are modified by relevant  antibody against  specific antigen expressed on the tumor cell 
surface to facilitate  the targeted magnetic hyperthermia, i.e. anti-HER2  antibody coated  
MNPs [27] and anti-Fas antibody -conjuga ted MNPs [28]. The kind of targeted 
magnetic hyperthermia could not  hurt normal tissue around tumor and allow MNPs to 
reach in the deep tissue, supporting a novel idea for cancer therapy.  Apart from 
artificially -synthesized MNPs  used in magnetic hyperthermia, the kind of biosynthetic 
magnetosomes  inside the cell s is also employ ed to kill cancer cells under an AMF. 
Magnetosomes could be modified easily due to their biological membrane , and have 
the feature of good biocompatibility  and single  magnetic  domain . Because of  their 
unique  characteristics , magnetosomes produce a la rger amount of heat than the smaller  
super paramagnetic chemi cally synthesized nanoparticles under the same AMF and hence has a good anti -tumor activity by using magnetic hyperthermia [29-32].  
Currently, magnetic hyperthermia has showed its effect against parasitic infections  
[33]. For pathogenic infection, especially caused by drug -resistant microbe , magnetic 
hyperthermia is  probably an effective way. Kim MH et al  showed that MNPs 
conjugated by anti -Protein A antibody were able to target S. aureus  and coul d kill the 
pathogen both in vitro  and in vivo  under the AMF [34]. Magnetotactic bacteria which 
synthesize magnetosomes were also applied to combat S. aureus -induced skin infection 
under an alternating magnetic field [35]. Antibody -coated magnetotactic bact eria could 
target S. aureus  because of the affinity between Protein A expressed in S. aureus  and 
the Fc fragment of the antibody (Figure 1a). After placed in alternating magnetic field, 
the length of the wound in mouse tail was reduced significantly, which  finally improved 
the healing effect (Figure 1b and 1c).

(b) Application of an alternating magnetic field to S. aureus -infected wound in mice tails. (c) The 
healing effect of the S. aureus -infected wound by  MO-1-mediated magnetic  hyperthermia [35].  
For both traditional and targeted magnetic h yperthermia, abundant  MNPs are used and then cause t emperature rise  in the bulk solution under an AMF . The temperature 
rise probably is the major reason for tumor or bacterial cell death. Particularly,  targeted 
MNPs are probably phagocytized by tumor cells , coated by vesicles and transferred to 
the lysosomes. Temperature rise by the MNPs under an AMF could result in the change 
of lysosomal membrane permeabilization or immediate destruction of lysosomes [24, 
26]. Under the condition, such factors from lysoso mes as chymotrypsin and cathepsin 
were released to cytoplasm and then activated cell apoptosis [36-37].  
When slight MNPs are used under an AMF to induce heat, a perceptible 
macroscopic temperature  rise is not monitored. However, the direct cellular effect  in a 
context of this sor t is still confirmed to be effective [25, 33, 38 -39]. So what does the 
cellular effect attribute to in the condition? Based on the development of biotechnology 
and nanotechnology, the temperature around MNPs was investigated and measured. 
Through different methods, those studies showed that the temperature on th e surface of 
MNPs is higher than that in the solution , although the l ocal high temperature decays 
exponentially with increasing distance  [40-44]. From the point of view, the local high 
temperature around MNPs could damage cell or organelle membrane  and cau se cell 
apoptosis or death, and thus may be a major factor for cellular effects especially in 
targeted hyperthermia.   
Considering the local temperature rise around MNPs under an alternating 
magnetic field, on the other hand,  some scholars  tried to use local high temperature to 
induce cellular effects, such as regulation of cell behaviors. They first attached MNPs 
to a temperature -sensitive ion channel and then applied an AMF to generate a local 
temperature rise around MNPs. Subsequently , the temperature -sensitive ion channel 
could be activated by the  high temperature. Whe n transient receptor potential A1  
(TRA1), a temperature -sensitive  cation channel , was conjugated by MNPs and then 
placed in a radio -frequency magnetic -field, the channel wa s activated by heat [40]. 
Chen R et al targeted MNPs to a transient receptor potential vanilloid -1 (TRPV1), and 
found that the nanoparticles trigger ed widespread and reversible firing of TRPV1+ 
neurons  when interacting with an  AMF  [45]. Further, the interplay of iron o xide 
nanoparticles  with an AMF was applied for deep brain stimulation [45] and regulation of plasma  glucose in mice [46]. The paramagnetic protein  ferritin was recently used to 
substitute for MNPs. Stanley  SA et al develop ed a genetically encoded system where 
GFP-tagged ferritin  associate d intracellularly with a camelid anti -GFP-TRPV1 fusion 
protein, which can activate  channel by the interaction of ferritin with noninvasive  low-
frequency radio waves  [47]. They also demonstrated that the system could be used to 
lower blood glucose  by remotely stimulating  insulin transgene expression with a radio -
frequency magnetic -field [47]. Later the same group improved the genetically encoded 
system  for non -invasive, temp oral activation or inhibition of neuronal activity in vivo  
by radio frequency treatment  and described its use  to study central nervous system 
control of glucose homeostasis  and feeding in mice  under [48]. These studies offer us 
the new tools to regulate cell functions.  
However, the controversy  over the temperature gradient around MNPs under an 
AMF existed as well. Some theoretical and experimental analyses showed that the 
temperature rise on the surface of MNPs was negligible  [49-52]. Moreover, Meister  M 
calculated the thermal energy induced by Ferritin under radio -frequency magnetic field 
and found that either temperature  increase or  gradient  cannot activate TRPV1 [53]. 
There might also  be other mechanisms in the process.  
3 Effect o f mechanical force  
Due to magnetic properties , MNPs are able to create mechanical force or torque 
when interacting with magnetic fields. If MNPs conjugate to the cell membrane or are 
endocytose d into cells, mechanical force could directly induce cellular effect.   
Generally, magnetic hyperthermia employs MNPs with the property of 
superparamagnetism  and isotropy . Upon applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field , 
MNPs will  display the  phenomenon  of oscillation.  The behaviors can generate shear 
forces  which may m ake cells broken directly or cause the incompleteness of organelle s 
that induced cell apoptosis. Carrey  J et al  theoretically studied and showed MNPs 
oscillate mechanically in an inhomogeneous AMF with the great possibility of creating 
shear force [54]. The theoretical results also  showed that oscillat ing MNPs may 
generate ultrasound  [56]. Ultrasound  is proved to give rise to cell apoptosis or dissolution [86 -87]. Besides, superparamagnetic  and isotropous MNPs are also placed 
in other magnetic fields to c reate mechanical force which directly induces cellular 
effects . Zhang E et al demonstrated that shear forces was generated by MNPs in an 
unique dynamic magnetic field,  which further induced cell death [55]. With regard to 
the effect induced by rotating MNP s under the magnetic field, Yue TT et al theoretically 
investigated the interaction mechanism between lipid membranes and rotating MNPs 
through simulation and found that the rotating nanoparticles promoted cell uptake and 
also rupture the mechanical membra ne [56].  
Anisotropic  MNPs  are extensively  exploited to induce cellular effect by generating 
mechanical force under various magnetic fields as well. Kim DH et al  first used  
microdiscs that possess a spin -vortex ground  state to interface with cells;  when an  
alternating magnetic field is applied , the microdisc vortices shift, creating an oscillation 
which transmits a  mechanical force to destruc t cancer  cell [57]. They show ed that the 
spin-vortex -mediated stimulus creates two dramatic effects: compromised inte grity of 
the cellular membrane,  and initiation of programmed cell death . Cheng  Y et al  
destruct ed glioma cells by applying  spin-vortex, disk -shaped permalloy magnetic 
particles in a low -frequency, rotating magnetic field  which could creat e a strong  
mechani cal force  and induce programmed cell death  [58]. Cheng  D et al  used rod-
shaped MNPs to induce HeLa cell viability decrease by about 2 -fold than  spherical 
MNPs  after being exposed to AMF  [59]. A swing magnetic field with low frequency 
and low heat-production  were designed i n order  to evaluate  the torque effect of 
magnetotactic bacteria on S. aureus  (Figure 2a and b) [60]. Under the swing magnetic 
field, the addition of magnetotactic bacteria in suspension of S. aureus  caused negligible  
temperature increase (Figure 2c), and S. aureus  was killed only when attached to 
magnetotactic bacteria (Figure 2d) [60]. Finally, we analyzed and calculated the 
mechanical force created by magnetotactic bacteria under the swing magnetic field with 
a valu e of 8.3kPa [60]. According to previous reports  [61-62], the mechanical force 
may be enough to induce the damage of S. aureus  or directly kill the pathogen.

Actually, the mechanical force from the interaction of MNPs and magnetic fields 
has been used for controlling cell status. By applying a gradient magnetic field , the 
magnetic nanoparticles g et a drag force (Figure 3a). When the nanoparticles bind to ion 
channels, the drag force may switch on the ion channel. Hughes  S et al showed that 
manipulation of MNPs  that targeted against  a mechanosensitive ion channel  TREK -1 
by a gradient magnetic field, could lead to the change of TREK -1 activity  and the 
whole -cell currents [63]. Lee JH et al proved that t he cube -shaped MNPs  bound  to 
components of cellular membranes and that their interplay with a magnetic field from 
an electromagnet can exert mechanica l force on  the cells, inducing the influx of ions 
into the hair cell [64]. Magnetic  force stimulation with ferromagnetic  nanoparticles 
under a gradient magnetic field was also found to trigger calcium influx in cortical neural  networks  [65]. Different from  the drag force, the torque of MNPs from the 
change of direction of the applied magnetic field was also used to control cells (Figure 
3b). Here an important thing to note  is that when the s uperparamagnetic nanoparticles 
are used, a magnetized field  should be first applied to magnetize  the kind of MNPs. 
After applying a strong external magnetic field to magnetize the modified microbeads, 
Wang N et al used the magnetized microbeads under a 90º -oriented magnetic field to 
create a torque that could the deformation  of cell cytoskeleton [66]. Chowdhury  F et al 
also used a strong  magnetic impulse  to magneti ze the micro beads  that attached to mouse 
embryonic stem cells  and found that microbeads promoted early developmen t of stem 
cells via applying a twisting field [67]. Besides, aggregation of MNPs may induce the 
cluster of MNPs -attached receptors under a magnetic field and then initiate the signal 
transduction, which is another approach to regulate cells (Figure 3c).  Cho MH et al 
applied a static magnetic field to aggregate MNPs bound  death receptor 4, which then 
promotes  apoptosis signal ing pathways [68].

Recently, the iron-sulfur  cluster assembly protein 1  or ferritin have been used to 
regulate cells by interplaying with magnetic fi elds. Different from the attachment of 
MNPs to ion channels via chemical methods, iron-sulfur  cluster assembly protein 1  or 
ferritin is co -expressed with ion channels through genetic tools to form a fusion proteins. 
Then an external magnetic field is appli ed to induce cellular effect. Long XY et al  
expressed an iron -sulfur  cluster assembly protein 1  in HEK -293 cells  and cultured 
hippocampal neurons ; and showed application of the external magnetic field resulted 
in membrane depolarization and calcium influx  [69]. Wheeler MA et al fused the cation 
channel TRPV4 to ferritin  to form  a single -component, magnetically sensitive actuator, 
“Magneto,”  and validated noninvasive magnetic control over neuronal activity  using 
the “Magneto ” [70].  
MNPs with different prope rties can generate mechanical force or torque under 
different kinds of magnetic fields. On the one hand, the mechanical force or torque 
could induce cellular effects by directly destructing cell membrane or l ysosomal 
membrane . On the other hand, the mechan ical force or torque changes the condition of 
the c ytoskeleton , intra cellular ion channel,  mitochondria  or other signal transduction 
pathway. Followed is that cells may experience  different status, such as growth, 
differentiation or death . Particularly, th e abnormal  conditions of ion channel trigged by 
mechanical force ，i.e. the abnormal switch on -off, e xcessive open  or close can induce  
cell apoptosis and death (see in review [71-73]). It provides us with a new thought  for 
cell regulation or diseases therapy. However, the theoretical calculation  from Meiste r 
M [53] showed that  mechanical force from the interaction of ferritins  with different 
kinds of magnetic field was unable to gate the ion channels. I nsufficient consi deration  
of factors in live cells  may be a reason that lead to the contradiction. Moreover, besides 
the heat and mechanical force, the interaction of MNPs with magnetic fields may result 
in chemical reactions such as free radical reaction. The kind of the undetermined  
mechanism is also an important reason.  
4 Effect of free radical  
Free radicals  such as reactive oxygen s pecies  (ROS) are  the product  of cellular 
metabolism  and participate in physiological functions . However, the over -generation of 
free radicals seriously impact normal cell activity. Domenech M et al demonstrated that 
lysosomal membrane permeabilization induced by MNPs under an AMF  is correlated 
with the production of ROS  [24]. Further, Connord V et al record ed AMF -induced 
production of ROS in cells  having incorporated DY647 -MNP s-gastrin in a real -time 
form and found that ROS level within cells submitted to the AMF increased signifi cantly compared to the cells outside  the AMF [74]. Upon application of  a static 
magnetic field, MNPs exert  synergistic  adverse effects such as reduced cell viability, 
apoptosis, and cell cycle aberrations on hepatocytes in vitro  and in vivo ; and the 
apoptotic effect was dependent on levels of ROS [75]. Combined exposure of extremely 
low frequency magnetic field (50 Hz,  400 μT) and MNP s-SiO2 resulted in remarkable 
cytotoxicity and  increased apoptosis in  the differentiated rat pheochromocytoma cell  
[76]. Superabundant  free radicals attack almost all of macromolecules including DNA, 
protein, carbohydrate  and lipids and hence are harmful to cells. O n the contrary , MNPs 
may decrease intracellular free radicals under magnetic fields. A study showed that 
MNPs could significant ly decrease in H 2O2-mediated oxidative stress  in combination 
with an external electromagnetic field  and act as  free radical scaveng er in the  cure of 
spinal cord injury [77]. Shin J et al also demonstrated that BMPs  enhanced cell growth  
and have anti -apoptotic effect in a static magnetic field [78]. However, they attributed 
the positive effect to the factor that the interplay  of BMPs  with external  static magnetic 
field within the cell may induce the alteration of the  diamagnetic anisotropy of 
membrane phospholipids , resulting in modulation  of cell s ignaling related to the  
membrane protein and the enhanced cell growth .  
Thus, based on currently available data, it seems likely  that MNPs could influence 
the different cellular effect by free radicals. On the one hand, magnetic nanoparticles 
could  play a role in catalytic ROS production . Through the release of Fe2+, MNPs take 
part in the production of ROS  by Fenton reaction . It’s dramatically  noted that when 
exposed under a magnetic field, MNPs may promote the process.  Wydra RJ described 
the a ccelerated generation of free radicals by MNPs  in the presence of an AMF [79]. 
Binhi V also theoretical ly analyzed the generation of free radicals by MNPs in a static 
magnetic  field and found that MNPs  can increase the rate of free radical formation  [80]. 
On this occasion , magnetic field generated by MNPs around themselves are orders of 
magnitude greater  than the  applied m agnetic field [76, 81] . The high magnetic field 
around MNPs may impact r adical pair  spin states , resulting in the decrease of 
recombination  rates  of radical pair particles  [82]. As a result, the free radicals increase. 
Of course, some argued that the heat stress created by MNPs under an AMF is likely to induce the production of free radicals  [83-84]. On the other hand, Fe 3O4 nano particles 
were actually found to have the catalytic  activity  of peroxidase  and catalase , which was 
called nanozyme [85-86]. The catalytic activity is  supposed to  be a scavenger  that 
eliminate s ROS in the cell. The nanozyme alone promotes  cell growth , which was 
attributed to the MNPs’ peroxidase -like activity  [87]. Overall, the direct cellular effect 
of free radicals possibly offers new clues  for disease treatment, especially killing o f 
tumor cells. Yet  the cellular effect of free radicals induced by MNPs under magnetic 
fields and their underlying mechanism should be studied  deeply . At the same time, 
whether MNPs as nanozyme are influenced by magnetic fields is not clear and also 
needs further investigations.  
4 Conclu sion and future perspectives  
In this a ccount , we reviewed concisely  the direct cellular effect of magnetic 
nanoparticles under different kinds of magnetic fields. We introduced the first cellular 
effect of magnetic nanopart icles under an alternating magnetic field which could be 
used in tumor therapy and infection treatment. The mechanism of cellular effect 
depends on the heat or temperature gradient around MNPs. Then another direct cellular 
effect was discussed particularly  in cell regulation because the interaction of MNPs 
with a magnetic field could create the mechanical force. The mechanical force could 
influence the ion channels or damage the cell membrane and further induce cell 
apoptosis or death. Meanwhile, it’s found  that mechanical force might involve in the 
cellular effect caused by heat. Finally, the effect of free radicals generated by MNPs 
when interplaying with a magnetic field was analyzed . Although some  current 
understanding  of cellular effects directly induced by MNPs in magnetic fields was 
shown here , some questions about how MNPs could directly induce cellular effect are 
still indistinct . The mechanisms of the cellular effect of heat and the relationship of 
MNPs’  peroxidase -like activity  with magnetic fields  need to be confirmed. Therefore, 
more  studies and experimental exploration into th ese mechanisms are quietly required 
and can further  lead to significant advances in various area of in-depth  biomedical 
applications  of MNPs under magnetic fields  such as precision m edicine  of diseases, cell or nerve regulation.
