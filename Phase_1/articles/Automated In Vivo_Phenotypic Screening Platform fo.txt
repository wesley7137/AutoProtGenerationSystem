Title: Automated In Vivo Phenotypic Screening Platform for Identifying Factors that Affect Cell Regeneration Kinetics.
Abstract: Various strategies for replacing retinal neurons lost in degenerative diseases are under investigation, including stimulating the endogenous regenerative capacity of Müller Glia (MG) as injury-inducible retinal stem cells. Inherently regenerative species, such as zebrafish, have provided key insights into mechanisms regulating MG dedifferentiation to a stem-like state and the proliferation of MG and MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs). Interestingly, promoting MG/MGPC proliferation is not sufficient for regeneration, yet mechanistic studies are often focused on this measure. To fully account for the regenerative process, and facilitate screens for factors regulating cell regeneration, an assay for quantifying cell replacement is required. Accordingly, we adapted an automated reporter-assisted phenotypic screening platform to quantify the pace of cellular regeneration kinetics following selective cell ablation in larval zebrafish. Here, we detail a method for using this approach to identify chemicals and genes that control the rate of retinal cell regeneration following selective retinal cell ablation.
