Title: Site-specific bioorthogonal regulation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 expression for effective bone regeneration.
Abstract: Growth factor holds great promise for bone regeneration, and spatiotemporal control of their expressing through site-specific reactions is crucial but challenging for on-demand therapy. In this study, we present the development of a novel unnatural amino acids (UAAs)-triggered therapeutic switch (UATS) system, composed of an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA-synthase (aaRS)-tRNA pair and a bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene harboring premature stop codon, which enable in situ and on-demand initiation of the expression of BMP2. The resulting UATS system allowed specifically control of base expressing on the BMP2 mRNA that switched to the BMP2 protein with complete structure and function to facilitate bone regeneration. Our investigations showed that the UATS system exhibits remarkable attributes of rapid, sensitive, reversible, and sustained BMP2 expression both in vitro and in vivo settings. Moreover, the implantation of microencapsulated cells with UATS system is applied to a mouse femur defect model, demonstrating high effciency in controlled expressing of BMP2 protein and substantial repair of bone defect following oral administration of UAAs. Therefore, our findings underscore the great potential of UATS system for on-demand awakening of functional growth factor, thus offering promising prospects in the realm of regenerative medicine.
