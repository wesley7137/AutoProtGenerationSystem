Title: Generation of Induced-Primary Retinal Pigment Epithelium from Human Retinal Organoids.
Abstract: Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) serve multiple roles, including among others, modeling RPE development in normal and pathological conditions, investigating mechanisms of RPE physiology, modeling retinal diseases involving the RPE, and developing strategies for regenerative therapies. We have developed a simple and efficient protocol to generate RPE tissue from human iPSCs-derived retinal organoids. The RPE tissue present in the retinal organoids is analogous to the native human RPE in differentiation timeline, histological organization, and key features of functional maturation. Building upon this system, we established a method to generate functionally mature, polarized RPE monolayers comparable to human primary RPE. This comprehensive protocol outlines the steps for isolating and culturing RPE tissue using retinal organoids. The outcome is a pure population of cells expressing mature RPE signatures and organized in a characteristic cobblestone monolayer featuring robust ultrastructural polarization. These RPE monolayers also exhibit the functional hallmarks of bona fide mature RPE cells, providing a suitable system to mimic the biology and function of the native human RPE.
