1. Introduction
Stem cell regeneration is a critical biological process in the development and maintenance of tissues,
ensuring their self-renewal and homeostasis[1]. The intricate interplay between gene expression regulation
and cell population dynamics is central to maintaining dynamic equilibrium during stem cell regeneration.
However, as these processes are typically described by distinct mathematical models, bridging the gap
between their scales of dynamics is imperative.
In the context of heterogeneous stem cell regenerations, a comprehensive mathematical framework has
emerged, integrating cell division behavior with cell heterogeneity and random transition of epigenetic

Preprint submitted to Elsevier April 19, 2024arXiv:2404.11761v1  [q-bio.MN]  17 Apr 2024states[2, 3]. This framework introduces a variable x, often a high-dimensional vector, to represent the
epigenetic state of a cell. The evolution of the population of cells with epigenetic state x, denoted as Q(t,x),
is governed by a differential-integral equation[2, 3]


c(t) =Z
ΩQ(t,x)ζ(x)dx.(1.1)
Here, β,κ, and µrepresent the rates of cell proliferation, differentiation/senescence, and apoptosis, re-
spectively; τindicates the duration of cell proliferation; ζsignifies the rate of cytokine secretion. The
concentration of growth factors secreted by all cells is denoted by c, and p(x,y) quantifies the probabil-
ity of transferring epigenetic states during cell division. The equation (1.1) was proposed by generalizing
the classical G0 cell cycle model and incorporating the epigenetic state of individual cells represented by a
continuous multidimensional variable[2].
The epigenetic state xin (1.1) represents intrinsic cellular states that may dynamically change over time
within a cell cycle or during cell division. Biologically, the epigenetic state of a cell can refer to molecular
level changes that are independent of the DNA sequences, including DNA methylation, nucleosome histone
modifications, and gene expression[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The epigenetic state may influence the quantification
of cellular behaviors, such as proliferation ( β), differentiation ( κ), apoptosis ( µ), and cell cycle ( τ), which
collectively define the kinetotype of a cell[2].
Gene regulatory dynamics within a cell cycle are often described by a set of ordinary or stochastic
differential equations
dX
dt=F(X) +η(t), (1.2)
where Xrepresents the vector of gene expression. The function Fdescribes the regulatory relationship
defined by gene regulatory networks, and η(t) denotes the stochastic fluctuations in molecular concentration
changes. When the epigenetic state xis associated with gene expression levels X, e.g., x= log(1 + X),
equation (1.2) describes the dynamics of the epigenetic state inside a single cell.
In addition to gene regulatory dynamics within a cell cycle, epigenetic states undergo random changes
during cell division, leading to cell plasticity in regeneration. This randomness is encapsulated by the
inheritance function p(x,y) in (1.1), which plays a crucial role in characterizing cell type changes. However,
precisely formulating this function poses challenges due to the complexity of biochemical reactions during
cell divisions.
Biologically, p(x,y) represents the probability that a daughter cell with state xoriginated from a mother
2cell with state yafter division. Thus, treating p(x,y) as a conditional probability density
p(x,y) =P(state of dauther cell = x|state of mother cell = y), (1.3)
we can focus on the epigenetic state before and after cell division while simplifying the analysis of the interme-
diate processes. The mathematical formulation of the inheritance function is often difficult to derive following
the complex biological process. Numerical simulations based on epigenetic state inheritance laws[10, 11, 12]
offer phenomenological representations of the inheritance function. For instance, normalized nucleosome
modifications follow a beta distribution[10], while transcript levels follow a gamma distribution[13]. Never-
theless, how the structure of the gene regulation network may be involved in the inheritance function remains
not known.
This study aims to develop a computational scheme linking gene regulatory network dynamics and stem
cell regeneration through a data-driven formulation of the inheritance function. We focused on a well-
studied gene network governing cell fate decisions and cell type switches, devising a numerical scheme to
obtain the conditional probability density p(x,y). The obtained density function, verified through stochastic
simulation, provides insights into how gene regulatory network structure influences inheritance. Importantly,
our numerical scheme offers a pathway for extending these findings to broader gene regulatory networks,
facilitating deeper insights into the nexus between gene regulation dynamics and stem cell regeneration.
2. Model and Method
We referred to the hybrid model of stem cell differentiation developed to study the dynamics of cell-type
transitions mediated by epigenetic modifications[14]. This model integrates individual-cell-based modeling
of a multicellular system, dynamics of a gene regulation network (GRN) involving two genes, a G0 cell cycle
model governing cell regeneration, and stochastic inheritance of epigenetic states during cell divisions.
2.1. Hetereogeneous G0 cell cycle model
In our model, we focused solely on cells capable of cycling, excluding those that had lost this capacity from
the simulation pool. We utilized the G0 cell cycle model to describe the dynamics of stem cell regeneration[15,
16]. According to this model, cells progress through a resting phase known as G0, during which they undergo
growth and prepare to enter the proliferative phase upon receiving cell cycling checkpoint signals (Fig. 1).
Each cell in the resting phase has the potential to either enter the proliferating phase at a rate βor exit the
resting pool at a rate κdue to processes such as terminal differentiation, senescence, or death. Cells in the
proliferating phase are random eliminated at a rate µdue to apoptosis or undergo mitosis at a fixed time τ
following entry into the proliferative compartment. Mitosis results in the generation of two daughter cells
from each mother cell. The newborn cells then enter the resting phase, initiating the next cycle.
3Figure 1: G0 cell cycle model of cell regeneration . Schematic representation of the G0 model depicting stem cell
regeneration. Cells in the resting phase either enter the proliferative phase at a rate βor exit the resting pool at a rate κdue
to differentiation, senescence, or death. Proliferating cells undergo apoptosis at a rate µ.
Biologically, the self-renewal capability of a cell is intricately linked to microenvironmental conditions,
including growth factors, various cytokines, and intracellular signaling pathways[17, 18, 19]. Despite the
complexity of these pathways, the phenomenological formation of Hill function dependence can be derived
from simple assumptions regarding interactions between signaling molecules and receptors[2, 20], expressed
as:
β=β0θn
θn+cn, (2.1)
where β0denotes the maximum proliferation rate, crepresents the impact of cytokine signals released from all
stem cells, θrepresents the half-effective concentration of cytokines, and nstands for the Hill coefficient. This
cytokine signal often depends on the collective state of all stem cells within the niche under consideration,
forming a feedback loop in cell growth.
Proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and cell apoptosis (or cell death at the resting phase) are piv-
otal in determining the population dynamics of multicellular systems. Furthermore, cellular heterogeneity,
characterized by variance in the epigenetic state of each cell, significantly influences these processes. The
kinetic rates of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of each cell are dependent on its epigenetic states.
To represent this heterogeneity, we introduced a variable x(typically a high-dimensional vector) for the epi-
genetic state of a cell and Ω as the space encompassing all potential epigenetic states of the resting-phase
stem cells[2, 3, 21]. Through the epigenetic state x∈Ω, let Q(t,x) denote the count of cells in the resting
phase at time twith epigenetic state x, and the total cell count is given by
Q(t) =Z
ΩQ(t,x)dx.
Ifξ(x) represents the rate of cytokine secretion by a cell with the state x, the effective cytokine concentration
4regulating cell proliferation is expressed as
c(t) =Z
ΩQ(t,x)ζ(x)dx.
Moreover, the kinetic rates β,κ,µ, and the duration of the proliferating phase τare dependent on the
epigenetic state x. The quadruple ( β(c,x), κ(x), µ(x), τ(x)) constitutes the kinetotype of a cell[2].
During cell division, a single mother cell divides into two daughter cells. However, these daughter cells
may not share the same epigenetic state as the mother cell, leading to cell plasticity in cellular regulation. By
introducing an inheritance function (also known as the transition function) p(x,y) defined by the conditional
probability density (3.9), the evolution equation (1.1) for the cell population Q(t,x) can be derived from the
G0 cell cycle model as follows[2]:


∂Q(t,x)
∂t=−Q(t,x)(β(c(t),x) +κ(x))

c(t) =Z
ΩQ(t,x)ζ(x)dx.(2.2)
Equation (2.2) provides a comprehensive mathematical framework for modeling the dynamics of hetero-
geneous stem cell regeneration with epigenetic transitions.
2.2. Gene regulation network
2.2.1. Ordinary differential equation model
We introduced gene regulation networks to establish connections between the epigenetic state and gene
expressions within individual cells. For simplicity, we considered a basic gene network comprising two master
transcription factors (TFs), namely gene A and gene B. These factors exhibit self-activation and mutual
repression, as illustrated in Figure 2. Let X1andX2denote the expression levels (protein concentration)
of genes A and B, respectively. While we focus on the master genes A and B, the gene expression levels
X= (X1, X2) define the epigenetic state of a cell.
The kinetics of gene expression within one cell cycle is modeled using the following ordinary differential
equations (ODEs):

half-effective protein concentrations for the corresponding regulation; nijare the Hill coefficients; kidenote

Folllowing the setup in RACIPE[22], we define a function Has

and equation (2.3) can be expressed as
dXi
dt=gi2Y
j=1H(Xj;hji, nji, λji)−kiXi,(i= 1,2) (2.4)
for simplicity.
It is worth noting that the gene network in Figure 2 can be modeled using two different approaches:
additive or multiplicative regulations, where the production rates from positive and negative feedbacks are
either added or multiplied, respectively[23, 24]. This study adopts the multiplicative modeling approach,
consistent with the model described by Jolly et al. (2015)[23]. However, the computational scheme presented
in this study remains consistent with additive feedback regulations.
2.2.2. Random perturbation to model parameters
In equation (2.4), the production rates gi, effective concentrations hij, and degradation rates kimay
experience random fluctuations due to the extrinsic noise in the cellular environment. To incorporate the
effects of these random perturbations, we introduced stochastic fluctuations to each parameter a(a=gi, hij,
orki) as follows:
a= ¯aeση−σ2/2, (2.5)
6where σrepresents the intensity of the noise perturbation, and ηfollows a colored noise pattern defined by
the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:
dη=−(η/ϑ)dt+p
2/ϑdW, (2.6)
where Wdenoting the Wiener process and ϑrepresents the relaxation coefficient.
Unlike the conventional Langevin stochastic differential equation approach, the random perturbation η
in (2.5) is expressed exponentially. This form has been previously utilized in research studies to simulate
extrinsic noise perturbations in gene expression[11, 14, 25]. The exponential form (2.5) avoids potential is-
sues with negative parameter values that may arise with the Langevin approach a→a+ση. In biochemical
reactions, a chemical rate ais often associated with a chemical potential µthrough a=ce−βµ. Consequently,
a perturbation to the chemical potential µnaturally translates into an exponential form perturbation in the
chemical reaction rate. Moreover, gene expression rates have been observed to follow a log-normal distri-
bution rather than a normal distribution[26]. Thus, formulating the random perturbation by multiplying
the log-normal distribution random number is appropriate. Here, the random perturbation is defined by an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to Lei (2011)[27] and Huang et al.
(2024)[14].
It is important to note that (2.5)-(2.6) provide a general formulation for noise perturbation to a parameter.
However, the perturbations ηto different parameters gi,hijandkiin equation (2.4) are independent of each
other. Additionally, parameters σandϑdefining the noise perturbations differ for perturbations to different
parameters. Thus, the ODE model (2.3) can be extended as the following stochastic differential equation
(SDE) model:

2.2.3. Cross-cell-cycling dynamics
The SDE model (2.7) describes the gene regulation dynamics within a single cell cycle. To extend these
dynamics across multiple cycles and link them with the heterogeneous G0 cell cycle model (2.2), we must
integrate the cell cycling process into the equation (2.7).
7Figure 3: Illustration of a cell cycle and the cycling age. Here Tdenotes the duration of one cycle, T1means the duration
of G0/G1 phase, and T2represents the duration of S phase.
During the proliferative phase, a cell undergoes DNA replication, resulting in a change in its genetic
content. Consequently, the gene expression rates vary throughout this phase. For simplicity, let Trepresent
the duration of one cycle, with the cycling age ℓdenoted as 0 < ℓ < T 1for the G0/G1 phase, T1< ℓ < T 1+T2
for the S phase (DNA replication), and T1+T2< ℓ < T for the G2 and M phase post-DNA replication
(Figure 3). Let ℓ(t) represents the cycling age defining as
ℓ(t) =t−kT, kT ≤t <(k+ 1)T,(k= 0,1,2,···). (2.8)
We defined the changes in DNA content with the cell cycling age as
ν(t) =

1, 0≤ℓ(t)< T1
(1 +ℓ−T1
T2), T 1≤ℓ(t)<(T1+T2)
2, (T1+T2)≤ℓ(t)< T(2.9)
for simplicity. Through the DNA content ν(t), we replaced giwith giν(t) and rewrote (2.4) as:
dXi
dt=giν(t)2Y
j=1H(Xj;hji, nji, λji)−kiXi,(i= 1,2) (2.10)
when kT≤t <(k+ 1)T.
The cell undergoes mitosis when t=kT. Molecules such as proteins and mRNAs redistribute stochasti-
cally to two daughter cells. Therefore, the protein concentrations X1andX2in the newborn cell should be
reset post-mitosis while molecules are allocated to the two daughters. Thus, we reset the initial condition at
t=kTas
Xi(kT) =χilim
t→kT−Xi(t) (2.11)
where χiis a beta distribution random number.
8We assumed a beta distribution random number with a density function exhibiting various shapes based
on shape parameters aandb, including strictly decreasing ( a <1, b≤1), strictly increasing ( a >1, b≤1),
U-shaped ( a <1, b < 1), or unimodal ( a >1, b > 1). We denote the beta distribution random number as
χi∼Beta( a, b), where shape parameters a, bsatisfy
E(χi) =a

We can select proper parameters to describe the situations of either symmetry or asymmetry division. In
this study, we introduced two parameters 0 < ϕ < 1 and η >0 so that
E(χi) =ϕ,var(χi) =1
1 +ηϕ(1−ϕ), (2.12)
then the shape parameters aandbare given by
a=ηϕ, b =η(1−ϕ).
In particular, we took ϕ=1
2, then η >2 yields a unimodal distribution, corresponding to symmetry division,
while η <2 gives a U-shape distribution, corresponding to asymmetry division (Figure 4).

Therefore, considering cell cycling, we integrated equations (2.7)-(2.11) to formulate a hybrid model as

In the equation (2.13), the coefficient λjiin the function H(xj;hji, nji, λji) represents positive regulation
(λji>1), negative regulation ( λji<1), or no regulation ( λji= 0) between genes jandi. Thus, it is easy
to extend the model equation to the dynamics of a general gene regulation network with mgenes.
The equation (2.13) describes the dynamics of the gene regulation network over multiple cell cycles, with
the protein levels reset after cell division.
This study does not consider the effect of cell volume change. Cell growth and volume changes are
significant biological processes that play essential roles in cell-fate decisions[28, 29]. Moreover, biological
mechanisms controlling cell growth and division are complex and not fully understood for mammalian cells[30,
31, 32]. In this study, we focused on the computational scheme connecting gene regulation network dynamics
with stem cell regeneration to avoid complexity. We assumed that the volume remains unchanged during
cell cycling, so cell growth does not affect the protein concentration.
2.2.4. Numerical implementation
Implementing the model equation (2.13) numerically includes solving the SDE model within a cell cycle
and managing the process of cell division. Cell division may lead to cell splitting and the resetting of initial
conditions for newborn cells. This numerical scheme can be realized using the object-oriented programming
language C++. The dynamics of gene regulatory networks within a cell cycle are modeled with the SDE model,
which is numerically solved through the Runge-Kutta method. Additionally, we designed an individual-cell-
based numerical scheme to monitor the dynamics of each cell within the system. Specific algorithm details
are provided in the Appendix.
10In our numerical implementations, we focused on symmetric gene regulations, assuming k1=k2,λ12=
λ21,λ11=λ22,n11=n12=n21=n22, and normalized the protein concentrations so that h11=h12=h21=
h22. The parameter values were estimated based on previous studies for the similar gene network[14, 23, 33],
and further adjustments were made to ensure that cells could exhibit various phenotypes with different gene
expression levels.
2.3. Inheritance function
Connecting the dynamics of the gene regulation network with the heterogeneous cell cycle model (2.2)
requires identifying the epigenetic state xand deriving the inheritance function p(x,y) based on the gene
regulation dynamics (2.13) across a cell cycle.
It is important to note that while the epigenetic state xin (2.2) represents a constant reflecting the state
of a cell during the resting phase, it dynamically changes over time in (2.13), representing gene expression
dynamics during a cell cycle. We need to identify the epigenetic state xin accordance with the gene
expression dynamics X(t) in one cell cycle. For consistency, we define the epigenetic state xof a cell
through log normalization of gene expression X(t) as
x= log( X(t) + 1)|ℓ(t)=ℓ∗ (2.14)
with the time tcorresponding to a specific cell cycling age ℓ∗. In our simulations, we took T= 50, and
T1= 25, T2= 8. We considered the state at ℓ∗=T1, which is the time point before DNA replication, as the
cycling age to define the epigenetic state of a cell during a cell cycle.
To obtain the inheritance function from simulation results, we numerically solved the cross-cell-cycle
stochastic differential equation (2.13) and tracked the gene expression X(t) of individual cells over cell
divisions. Since (2.13) describes the gene expression dynamics of a single cell over multiple cycles, two
daughter cells were recorded when a cell divided. Thus, we repeated the numerical scheme to obtain an
ensemble of multiple cells, with each simulation starting with a randomly selected initial condition. For each
cell under simulation, record the state X=X(t)|ℓ=T1so that x= log( X+1) represents the epigenetic state
of the cell. This process yields a dataset D={xk,yk}, where ykrepresents the state of the k’th mother cell
andxkthe state of one daughter cell of the k’th mother cell. Through dataset D, we obtain the inheritance
function p(x,y) via the conditional probability density defined by (3.9).
For the probability density function p(x,y), we assumed that the inheritances of gene A and gene B were
independent of each other, yielding
p(x,y) =2Y
i=1pi(xi,y),
where pi(xi,y) denotes the conditional density function of xigiven the state of the mother cell y= (y1, y2).
11In our study, we presumed the mixed conditional gamma distribution for epigenetic states so that
pi(xi,y) =kX
j=1αi,jGamma( xi;ai,j, bi,j),(i= 1,2), (2.15)
where kis the number of independent distributions, αi,jare combination coefficients, and Gamma( x;a, b)
represents the probability function of gamma distribution with shape parameters aandb, expressed as
Gamma( x;a, b) =xa−1e−(x/b)

0e−xxz−1dx, z > 0. (2.16)
The combination coefficients αi,jsatisfy
kX
j=1αi,j= 1, α i,j≥0.
In (2.15), the shape parameters ai,jandbi,jdepend on the state yof the mother cell.
To determine the shape parameters, we consider that, given the probability density function (2.16), the
conditional mean and variance are
E(x|y) =a(y)b(y),var(x|y) =a(y)b(y)2.
Thus, while we assume the conditional mean and variance as
E(x|y) =ψ(y),var(x|y) =ψ(y)2
ζ(y), (2.17)
we have
a(y) =ζ(y), b(y) =ψ(y)/ζ(y). (2.18)
Thus, to obtain the inheritance function p(x,y), we only need to derive, for each component xi, the
functions ψi,j(y) and ζi,j(y) through the conditional mean and variance from the simulation data. The
detailed procedure for obtaining the inheritance function is provided in Section 3.2.
3. Results
3.1. Identification of cell types through epigenetic states
To quantitatively define cell phenotypes, we conducted a bifurcation analysis based on the ODE model
(2.3). We varied the production rates g1andg2while keeping other parameters fixed and examined the
dependence of steady states on these parameter values. Figure 5a illustrates the number of steady states
with randomly varying parameters ( g1, g2). When g1andg2are large, three steady states emergy (depicted

by red dots in Figure 5a). Additionally, at ( g1, g2) = (0 .4,0.4), solving the ODE (2.3) with varying initial
conditions results in the convergence of solutions ( x1(t), x2(t)) to one of the two stable steady states, as
indicated by the black dots in Figure 5b. These stable steady states exhibit expression patterns of either
(+,−) or (−,+) for the maker genes A and B, defining two distinct cell phenotypes.
The bifurcation analysis reveals bistable steady states in gene network dynamics, corresponding to differ-
ent cell types defined by marker gene expression patterns. To further explore how external noise perturbation
and cell divisions may shape the heterogeneous within a cell clone, we examined the dynamics of the hybrid
model (2.13) under various noise strength σ(assuming σ1=σ2=σ3=σ) and cell division scenarios.
First, we excluded cell cycling and focused solely on gene expression dynamics with external noise
perturbation. To achieve this, we solved the SDE model (2.7) with randomly selected initial conditions
0< X i(0)<2. Figure 6a illustrates the distributions of the epigenetic state of cells at one cycle ( T= 50)
with varying noise strength σ. Results indicate distinct cell phenotypes when the external noise is small
(σ= 0.2 or 0 .4); however, the two cell types merge as the noise strength σincreases.
Next, we explored the influence of cell division using the hybrid model (2.13). The effect of cell division is
depicted by the redistribution of molecules through (2.11), with parameters ϕandηdefining the distribution
of the coefficient χi. We fixed ( ϕ, η) = (0 .5,60) (Figure 4d) and varied the noise strength σto solve (2.13).
Here, we initiated the system with one cell and simulated model dynamics for 15 cycles, resulting in 215
cells at the 15th cycle, all originating from a single cell. Figure 6b displays the epigenetic states of all cells,
showing a similar pattern to Figure 6a, generated from multiple cells with different initial conditions. This
suggests that a single cell can give rise to a heterogenous cell clone through cell division.
Furthermore, to investigate the effects of different assumptions in cell division, we varied the parameter η
13Figure 6: Distribution of the epigenetic state of cells under different model assumptions .(a). Epigenetic states of
cells at t= 50 (one cell cycle) without cell division. The cell states were obtained by solving the SDE model (2.7) with initial
conditions randomly distributed over 0 < Xi(0)<2.(b). Epigenetic state of cells derived from a single cell after 15 divisions.
The cell states were obtained by solving the hybrid model (2.13), with initially a single cell having random gene expression

Same as (b) with asymmetric division ( η <2) and different distributions for the parameter χi. Here, the epigenetic states are
represented by x= log( X(t) + 1)|ℓ(t)=T1. In (a), no cell division was considered, and different external perturbation strengths
σwere applied. In (b)-(d), cell division was considered, with ϕ= 0.5 and different parameters ηfor the distribution of χi(refer
to (2.12)). The values of σandηare shown in the figure; the parameters ϑ1=ϑ2=ϑ3= 0.3; the conditional perspective ϕ
in (2.12) was set as ϕ= 0.5; the cell cycling parameters were T= 50, T1= 25, T2= 8; other parameters were the same as in
Figure 5.
14in defining the distribution of the coefficient χi. Fixing σ= 0.4, we adjusted ηto reflect symmetry division
(10 to 1000), resulting in a decreased variance of χi. The distribution of epigenetic states in Figure 6 appears
independent of the parameter η. Similarly, varying ηto reflect asymmetric division (ranging from 1 to 0 .01)
yields consistent distributions of epigenetic states at the 15th cycle, as shown in Figure 6d. These results
suggest that the distribution of the epigenetic states of a cell clone remains insensitive to the variance of χi
in cell division.
For subsequent discussions below, we focused on the method of obtaining the inheritance function through
simulation data, with fixed values of ϕ= 0.5, η= 60, and σ= 0.4.
3.2. Data-driven inheritance function
In Figure 6, we have demonstrated the variability of epigenetic states in individual cells originating from
a single cell. The variability reflects the stochastic changes in cell states during cell division. To derive the
inheritance function p(x,y) based on the gene regulation dynamics (2.13), we tracked the process of cell
division through numerical simulations. We recorded the state of the mother cells ( y) and the daughter
cells ( x) following each cell division event. In our simulations, we initiated 106cells. For each cell, we
simulated the model for 3 cell cycles, considering all cells at the second cycle as mother cells and denoting
their epigenetic states as y. For each mother cell with state y, we paired it with the epigenetic state xof
the corresponding daughter cell at the third cycle, forming a pair [ x,y] = [( x1, x2),(y1, y2)]. Here, x1and
y1represent the state associated with gene A, while x2andy2represent the state associated with gene B.
Figure 7a and 7b present scatter plots illustrating the epigenetic states of genes A and B in mother cells
and their daughter cells. These plots reveal distinct cell types: mother cells with lower expression in gene
A (or gene B) typically produce daughter cells with similarly lower expression levels in the same gene, while
those with higher expression tend to generate daughter cells with elevated expression levels in the same
gene. However, we also observe instances of cell type switches during cell divisions, where some daughter
cells exhibit gene expression patterns differing from those of their mother cells.
To establish the mathematical formulation of the inheritance function, we utilized gene A as an example
to illustrate the computational method. We identified all mother cells with a specific expression level (as
delineated by the two strips in Figure 7a) and examined the probability density of the expression levels of all
daughter cells. Figure 7c illustrates the resulting conditional probability densities with the epigenetic state
of mother cells y1= 0.3 and y1= 0.8, respectively. These density functions exhibit characteristics akin to a
combination of two unimodal distributions (solid lines in Figure 7c).
Drawsing insights from Figure 7c, we modeled the probability density p1(x1,y) with a combination of
two gamma distributions:
p1(x1,y) =α1×Gamma( x1;a1,1, b1,1) + (1 −α1)×Gamma( x1;a1,2, b1,2). (3.1)

Dots were obtained from data analysis, and solid lines represent the functions of a combined gamma distribution. The densities
were obtained from data in the two strips in (a). (d). The function ψ1,1(y1).(e). The function ζ1,1(y1).(f). The function

from data analysis, while curves or surfaces were derived from mathematical formulations.
16Here, the shape coefficients a1,jandb1,jdepend on the state of the mother cell ythrough the functions
ψ1,j(y|) and ζ1,j(y), which are associated with the conditional mean and variance E( x1|y) and var( x1|y) in
accordance with (2.17). Additionally, the combination coefficients α1may vary based on the state of the
mother cell y.
To determine the coefficients α1,a1,jandb1,j, we initially presumed their dependence solely on the com-
ponent y1. From Figure 7a, we partitioned the data into multiple bins based on the y1value. Subsequently,
we segregated the x1values in each bin into two subgroups and calculated the mean and variance in each
subgroup, thus deriving the conditional means E(x1|y1) and variances var( x1|y1) for the two gamma distri-
butions Gamma( x1;a1,j, b1,j),j= 1,2. This process yielded the functions ψ1,j(y1) and ζ1,j(y1) as Hill-type
functions following (2.17) (Figure 7d-g):

The shape parameters were formulated as
a1,j(y1) =ψ1,j(y1), b1,j(y1) =ψ1,j(y1)/ζ1,j(y1). (3.3)
Subsequently, we assumed that the combination coefficient α1depends on both y1andy2. Consequently,
we partitioned the ( y1, y2) phase plane into multiple bins and gathered the daughter cell epigenetic states
x1in each bin. We then employed the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, as per (3.1), to determine
the coefficients α1,jfor each bin. The results, illustrated in Figure 7h, closely align with a Hill-type function:
α1(y) = 0 .16 +y6

Thus, the function α1(y) and the shape parameters a1,j(y1), b1,j(y1) collectively define the inheritance func-
tionp1(x1;y) per (3.1).
Similarly, we derive the inheritance function p2(x2;y) for gene B:
p2(x2;y) =α2(y)×Gamma( x2;a2,1, b2,1) + (1 −α2(y))×Gamma( x2;a2,2, b2,2). (3.5)
Remarkably, owing to the symmetry between gene A and gene B, simulation data exhibit the same forms of
17ψ2,j(y2) and ζ2,j(y2) as the functions ψ1,j(y1) and ζ1,j(y1), respectively. Consequently:

The function α2(y) is shown in Figure 7i.
Finally, the inheritance function is expressed as:
p(x;y) =p1(x1;y)×p2(x2;y). (3.9)
The above procedure delineates the processes of acquiring the inheritance function in (2.2) from simulation
data based on the gene regulation network model in (2.13). Validation of the inheritance function (3.9) is
presented in section 3.3.
The gamma distribution density functions Gamma( xi;ai,j(yi), bi,j(yi)) defined by (3.1), (3.5), and (3.9)
describe the inheritance of daughter cells from the mother cells for the same gene, while the combination
coefficients α1(y) and α2(y) elucidate the property of cell type transition regulated by the gene regulation
network. Notably, α1(y) increases with y1and decreases with y2, signifying the activation of gene A by itself
and the inhibition of gene B to gene A. A similar pattern is observed in α2(y). Thus, the gene regulation
network structure influences the inheritance function through its qualitative dependence on the state of
mother cells.
3.3. Validation of the inheritance function
To verify the data-driven inheritance function, we compared simulation results obtained from the hetero-
geneous G0 cell cycle model (2.2) and the gene regulation network model (2.13).
Initially, we utilized the cell cycle model (2.2) to reproduce the process of cell clone generation from a
single cell and compared our findings with those in Figure 6. To achieve this, we defined the kinetotype in
18(2.2) as follows:
β= 1/T1, κ=µ= 0, τ=T−T1. (3.10)
Given that solving the high-dimensional integral in (2.2) directly is computationally expensive, we applied
an individual-cell-based simulation approach, adhering to the scheme outlined in equation (2.2).
To replicate the process illustrated in Figure 7, we initialized the system with 106cells, emulating the
setup in Figure 7, and performed individual-cell-based simulations to model the cell division process. During
cell division, each mother cell generated two daughter cells, with the epigenetic state of each daughter cell
determined by the inheritance function p(x,y) defined in (3.9) (see the Appendix for the detailed numerical
scheme). Similar to the methodology in Figure 7, we conducted simulations over 3 cycles and collected the
cells from the 2nd and the 3rd cycles for data analysis.
Figure 8 presents the data points of daughter cell epigenetic states against mother cell epigenetic states,
obtained from both the gene regulation network model (2.13) and the G0 cell cycle model (2.2) with the
inheritance function (3.9). A comparison of Figure 8a with Figure 8b demonstrates that the data-driven
inheritance function (3.9) effectively reproduces the distribution of the cross-cell cycling epigenetic states.
Figure 8: Comparison between the gene regulation network model and the G0 cell cycle model .(a). Scatter
plot of daughter cell epigenetic state (gene A) versus mother cell epigenetic state (gene A and B) following the gene regulation
network model (2.13). (b). Scatter plot of daughter cell epigenetic state (gene A) versus mother cell epigenetic state (gene A
and B) following the G0 cell cycle model (2.2) with inheritance function given by (3.9). Parameters were identical to those in
Figure 7, with cell cycling parameters given by (3.10) in G0 cell cycle model.
Next, we applied the G0 cell cycle model to investigate the biological process of heterogeneous cell growth
with additional regulations in proliferation and differentiation. For this purpose, we defined the kinetotype
as:
κ= 0.009, µ= 0.0007, τ=T−T1,
and
β(c,x) =β0θ
θ+c, c=Z
ΩQ(t,x)dx,
19with β0= 0.2 and θ= 106. Employing identical assumptions, we simulated the cell growth process following
the G0 cell cycle model (2.2) with the inheritance function (3.9). In our simulations, we initialized 104cells,
randomly assigning epigenetic states to each cell. We employed individual-cell-based simulation to model
cell growth up to t= 2500 (about 50 cycles).
In this scenario, we introduced nonzero differentiation and apoptosis rates, assuming that the prolifer-
ation rate decreases with the total cell number. Consequently, the cell number would eventually reach an
equilibrium state following an extended period of cell growth (Figure 9a). Figure 9b displays the distribution
of the epigenetic state of cells at t= 2000 (marked by the dashed line in Figure 9a). Notably, two subtypes
of cells are evident, with their epigenetic state distributions closely resembling those obtained from the gene
regulation network model in Figure 6. We further examined the dynamics of individual cell-type transitions.
Figure 9c-d illustrates the evolution dynamics of gene A and gene B while tracking a single cell during the
cell growth process. Our simulations demonstrate that cells can transition between the two subtypes as
the cell growth process unfolds. These results underscore the capability of the G0 cell cycle model (2.2) to
simulate the long-term dynamics of cell growth with heterogeneity.

204. Discussions
Our study investigated the inheritance of epigenetic states in cells using a combination of computational
modeling and data analysis. We developed a data-driven inheritance function based on the gene regulation
dynamics model and validated it using simulations from both a gene regulation network model and a het-
erogenous G0 cell cycle model. Our results demonstrate that the data-driven inheritance function effectively
captures the distribution of epigenetic states across cell generations. Furthermore, we applied the G0 cell
cycle model to simulate the long-term dynamics of cell growth with heterogeneity, showcasing its capability
to replicate the behavior observed in the gene regulation network model.
The findings of our study shed light on the mechanisms underlying the inheritance of epigenetic states in
cells. By combining computational modeling with data analysis, we were able to derive a robust inheritance
function that accurately predicts the distribution of epigenetic states in daughter cells based on their mother
cell’s states. This suggests that epigenetic inheritance is governed by complex regulatory processes embedded
within the gene regulation network.
Moreover, our simulations using the G0 cell cycle model revealed intriguing insights into the dynamics of
cell growth with heterogeneity. The model successfully reproduced the emergence of distinct cell subtypes
and their transitions over time, indicating that the heterogeneity observed in experimental data can be
attributed to underlying regulatory mechanisms within the cell cycle.
In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the inheritance of epigenetic states and the
dynamics of cell growth with heterogeneity. By developing and validating a data-driven inheritance function,
we have contributed to a deeper understanding of the regulatory processes governing cell behavior. Moving
forward, our findings could inform further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic
inheritance and their implications for cellular function and disease.

A. Numerical scheme for the hybrid kinetic modeling
We applied the numerical scheme to solve the hybrid model (2.13) by combining the numerical method
of stochastic differential equation and the random process of cell division. During numerical simulation,
the cell number is changed over time due to cell division. Each cell corresponds to a stochastic differential
equation defined by the gene regulatory network. Therefore, we need to track the gene expression dynamics
of each individual cell. The number scheme is given below:

B. Numerical scheme of the individual-cell-based simulation method
The differential-integral equation (2.2) can be solved numerically through the Euler method and numerical
integration. However, it is expensive to calculate the numerical integration due to the high-dimensional
epigenetic states. Hence, we usually do not solve the equation (2.2) directly. We apply an individual-cell-
based simulation method to simulate the cell cycling process.
In the model simulation, a multiple-cell system is represented as a collection of epigenetic states, and the
individual-cell-based simulation tracks the behaviors of each cell according to its own epigenetic states. The
sketch of the numerical scheme is given below.
22•input The parameters, kinetotype functions β,κ,µ, and τ, inheritance function p(x,y), and the time

- When a cell is at the proliferative phase, if the age a < τ , the cell is either removed
(through apoptosis) with a probability µ∆tor remains unchanged; if the age a≥τ, the
cell undergoes mitosis and divides into two cells.
end for

- If the cell fate is differentiation or apoptosis, remove the cell, and reduce the total cell number

- If the cell fate is entering the proliferative state, set the cell state at proliferative ( S= 1) and
the proliferating age a= 0, and let Nq=Nq−1,Np=Np+ 1, the total cell number Nis

- If the cell is at the proliferative phase and remains unchanged, update the proliferative age
a=a+ ∆t, the cell numbers Nq,Np, and Nare unchanged.
- If the cell is under mitosis, it produces two daughter cells, and the epigenetic state of each
daughter cell is determined according to the inheritance probability p(x,y). The proliferating
age of each daughter cell is set as a= 0, and update the cell number: Nq=Nq+2,Np=Np−1,
andN=N+ 1.
23end for
end for
To determine the epigenetic state of daughter cells according to the inheritance probability p(x,y) defined
by the combination gamma distribution (3.9), we applied the following numerical scheme:
•calculates the αi, ψi,j, ηi,jaccording to the state of the mother cell, and the coefficients ai,jandbi,j;
•fori= 1 to 2 do
- generates a random number q=rand();
- ifq < α i, produce the epigenetic state of gene ifor daughter cell according to the first gamma
distribution function Gamma( xi;ai,1, bi,1), otherwise, produce the epigenetic state according to
the second gamma distribution function Gamma( xi;ai,2, bi,2).
•set the epigenetic state of the daughter cells.
In simulations, the cell number may increase to a very high number through cell division, which may
cause a challenge issue in simulations. To overcome this issue, we applied a technique of downsampling . The
process of downsampling is often used in signaling analysis to reduce the data rate or the size of data. Here,
we applied a similar technique to reduce the number of cells under simulation.
We predefine a maximum number of cells to be simulated and stored ( Nmax= 106cells in the current
simulation). Let Nk=Nk,q+Nk,q(Nk≤Nmax) be the number of cells under simulation at step k, where
Nk,qrepresents the number of cells at the resting phase, and Nk,prepresent the number of cells at the
proliferative phase. We first opened a temporary storage space for Nk,q+ 2Nk,pcells (the maximum number
of cells if all proliferative phase cells undergo mitosis). After performing cell fate decisions for each cell,
we have potentially Ntemp =N′
k,q+N′
k,p(Ntemp≤Nk,q+ 2Nk,p) cells. If Ntemp > N max, we selected all
cells ( N′
k,pcells) in the proliferative phase and at most ( Nmax−N′
k,q) cells in the resting phase (select each
cell with a probability p= max {1,(Nmax−N′
k,q)/N′
k,q}) to obtain Nnextcells for the next step simulation;
otherwise, we select all Ntempcells, and set Nnext=Ntemp. Finally, we stored the state of all selected Nnext
cells, let fpro,k=Ntemp/Nkfor the proliferation rate, and Nk+1=Nnextfor the number of cells simulated
at step k+ 1.
According to the approach of downsampling simulation, at step k, there are Nk≤Nmaxcells under
simulation, and the states of these cells are stored; the real cell number is given by
Nreal number at step k=N0k−1Y
i=0fpro,i.
This gives the cell number at step k.
