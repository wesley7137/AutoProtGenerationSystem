Introduction 
The dental implant failure is frequently ascribed to 
large bone defect or surrounding poor bone quality. Functional restoration of bone following surgical 
interventions is a crucial step for the success and long 
term survival of orthopedic and dental implants[1, 2]. Although the bone graft is widely accepted as the standard in such surgical  site, inherent donor-site 
limitations with respect to tissue rejection and disease 
transfer are of particular shortcomings in 
autografting[2, 3]. A new strategy with bone tissue engineering by mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been dawn attention[1, 4-7]. 
Titanium is a primary metallic biomaterial used in 
orthopedic and dental implants[8, 9]. The surface scaffold properties of titanium surface, namely osteogenic gene expression of adherent cells play an 
important role in the bone tissue engineering of 
implants[4, 7, 10, 11]. A large number of surface modification techniques have already existed, including commercial ones. Rough surfaces such as the sand-blasted, acid-etched titanium implant have 
generally proven superior to smooth surface in terms 
of promoting bone-cells and implant contact at the interface[12-14]. The authors have reported that the wire-type electric discharge machining (W-EDM) of 
titanium allowed a microstructured titanium surface 
with an irregular morphology. W-EDM processes electro-conductive materials by spark discharge generated between a narrow metal wire and the 
material through running pure distilled water. This 
computer associated technique enables extremely accurate complex sample shaping. It also yields an optimal micro textured surface during the processing[15]. 
Various thicknesses of the oxide film the type of crystallinity, and the amount of oxygen incorporated into the surfaces of differently processed titanium 
samples have been reported[13, 16-18]. The thickness 
of oxide film is another important determinant of osteoblast responses on titanium as the thickness of oxide film may improve the surface free energy that accumulates functional gr oups and osteogenic 
biomolecules at the surface . The surface topography 
and chemistry are postulated to be two major factors increasing the osteoconductivity of titanium implants. Titanium alters the thickness of the surface oxide film 
even in a simple heated setting. Since the titanium 
oxide film is sensitively altered by each processing, the authors hypothesized that W-EDM processes the thickness of oxide film and micro topography at the 
same time. 
In this study, the chemical characteristics and surface topographies of titanium processed by W-EDM and titanium-coated W-EDM epoxy resin replicas were evaluated. The scaffold property of the samples was 
evaluated by the mRNA expression of MSC onto the 
samples.  
Materials and Methods  
Specimen Preparation  
JIS grade 2 titanium (KS-50, Kobe Steel, Kobe, Japan) was used as the starting material. The smooth surfaces of titanium plates, 10 x 10 x 1.0 mm, were 
gradually ground with waterproof polishing papers 
from #500 to #1200 under running water. They were then polished with alumina particles until an average 
diameter of 0.3 µm. W-EDM samples (W-EDM-Ti) of arXiv:1004.4045 [q-bio.CB ] 2the same dimensions were processed under conditions 
of 6.5 µsecond τ off (pulse off time) and 0.65  µsecond 
τ on (pulse on time) at 15 amps IP (peak current) and 
90 V (non-load voltage) (LS 350X, Japan). The samples were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, detergent solution (7X, ICN), and pure distilled water 
for 15 min of each cleaning process. The specimens 
were then dried and stored in a desiccator for 24 hrs in 50% humidity and at a temperature of 23°C.  
Preparation of replica surface topography 
The method for titanium coated replicas was given in the paper written by Burunett DM et al[19, 20]. Impressions of polished titanium and W-EDM 
surfaces were made with vinyl polysiloxane 
impression material (PROVIL
® novo Light , Heraeus 
Kulzer, Dormagen, Germany). Vinyl polysiloxane negative replicas were used to cast epoxy-resin 
(EPO-TEK 302-3, Epoxy Technology, Bellerica, MA) 
positive replicas of the surfaces. The epoxy replicas of polished titanium (Ti) and W-EDM were cleaned with in a detergent (7X) (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa 
Mesa, CA), baked at 60°C for 4 days, and 
sputter-coated (IB-2, Eiko Engineering, Tokyo, Japan) 
with 50 nm of Ti.  
 
Micro topography 
The micro topography of the samples was obtained 
using a scanning electron microscope (S-2360N, HITACHI, Hitachi, Japan). The average roughness of the samples was evaluated by a surface texture 
measuring instrument (SURFCOM, 480A, TOKYO 
SEIMITUS, Tokyo, Japa n). The results were 
expressed as the mean ± SD of 6 specimens (n = 6), and analyzed statistically by analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
 
Surface characterization XRD The crystal phases of the samples were detected by 
TF-XRD (XRD-6100, SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan) 
with CuK α radiation. XRD was operated at 40 kV, 40 
mA with a scanning speed of 0.02°/4 sec and a scanning range of 20-50°. 
 
XPS The surfaces of each specimen were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCA-3400, 
SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan). High-resolution spectra 
from a wide scan were analyzed using MgK α 
radiation. A 20-mA emission current and 8-kV 
accelerated voltage were applied for this analysis. The 
binding energies for each spectrum were calibrated with the C1s spectrum of 285.0 eV. The results were analyzed statistically by Student's t tests. Significant differences were considered  to exist when p < 0.01 
(n=6). 
 Expression of mRNA on the samples Rat MSCs (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were 
cultured on the titanium samples with α-MEM (Sigma, 
Tokyo, Japan) containing 10 % FBS, dexamethasone, 
ascorbic acid 2 phosphate and grycerophosophate at 
37 °C and 5 % CO
2 for 1 week. Expressions of 
integrin αV, osteopontin, and Cbfa-1 were obtained by 
RT-PCR 
 
Results  
Surface topographies  
The surface topography  of Ti appeared to be smoother 
than those of W-EDM-Ti and W-EDM replicas 
(Fig.1). Some amount of roughness and distinctive irregular features were observed on W-EDM-Ti and W-EDM replicas. Average surface roughnesses, Ra, 
of the samples were the same; the average for 
W-EDM-Ti was 19.5±0.5 µm, and for W-EDM 
replicas it was 19.6±0.4 µm (Fig.1). No significant 
differences (p > 0.01) were detected between 
W-EDM-Ti and W- EDM replicas. 
 
Surface characterization 
X-ray diffraction patterns of specimen are shown in 
Fig.2. Typical XRD patterns of titanium were detected similarly on Ti and W-EDM replicas. A peak of 42.5 
2θ (Cak α/degree) attributable to TiO appeared to be 
increased on W-EDM-Ti.  
High resolution spectra of Ti2p on each sample are shown. The binding energies of each spectrum between Ti and W-EDM replicas showed no 
significant differences (p<0. 01). The shoulder peak of 
Ti2p at 457.0 eV attributab le to TiO was increased on 
W-EDM-Ti compared to Ti and W-EDM replicas (not 
shown). 
 
Expression of mRNA 
Integrin αV expressions were detected only on 
W-EDM-Ti even after 6 hrs cultivation. The mRNA 
expression of osteopontin was observed after 1 wk on 
all samples. The expression of cbfa-1 on W-EDM-Ti was observed after 1 wk cultivation while that of W-EDM replica was observed after 2 wks. The 
expression of cbfa-1 on Ti was observed after 3 wks 
culture.   
 
Discussion The present investigation of surface characterization 
revealed that the superficial chemistry of Ti and W-EDM replicas was consistent. Since the surface topographies of W-EDM-Ti and W-EDM replicas showed no significant differences, W-EDM replicas 
could solely replicate the micro topography effect of 
W-EDM-Ti on in vitro  cellular responses. Both 
surface characterizations demonstrated that an increasing TiO peak was detected only on W-EDM-Ti 
samples. Oxygen incorporated into the W-EDM-Ti 
surface increased during processing. Thus, W-EDM processing could alter the superficial chemistry as well as the micro topogr aphy of titanium surfaces.  3Cells interact with titanium substrate via integrin 
binding to extra cellular matrix proteins[21, 22].The first phase integrin mediat ed cell adhesion mechanism 
is essential to achieve th e successful anchorage of 
endosseous implants[23]. The initial adhesion of cells is mediated by specific membrane receptors, mainly 
integrins αV[21, 22]. These recognize the biding 
domains of the RGD sequence of adsorbed serum 
proteins such as fibronectin or vitronectin on titanium surfaces. A thickness of TiO suboxide layer increases the surface free energy that accumulates functional 
groups and osteogenic biomolecules when exposed in 
biological fluids. Since the expression of integrin αV 
were detected only on W-EDM-Ti, even after 6 hrs 
cultivation, the increased TiO layer formed on the 
W-EDM-Ti increased the amount of cell binding serum proteins that could be  affected by the increased 
surface free energy. 
The Cbfa-1 is a related gene which indicates 
differentiation from MSCs to osteoblasts[24]. Recent studies have indicated that the different surface topographies of titanium distinctly modulate cell morphology of fibroblasts and osteoblastic cells at 
surfaces[10, 25].
 Morphological features of 
osteoblastic cells marked ly activated cytoplasmic 
stress fiber formation that is  associated with a more 
differentiated cellular phenotype. The present study 
showed some amount of roughness and distinctive 
irregular features on W-ED M-Ti and W-EDM replicas. 
Thus, Cbfa-1 expression on W-EDM-Ti and W-EDM replicas was up-regulated compared to that on smooth 
Ti samples.  
Both surface chemistry and topography of W-EDM-Ti up-regulated the mRNA expression of MSCs. W-EDM processing on titanium implants therefore enhances scaffold properties of MSCs to the surface. 
In conclusion, the thickness of oxide film and 
micro-topography performed on W-EDM-Ti has scaffold properties toward the MSCs. W-EDM is a promising candidate for MSC based functional 
restoration surrounding implants.
