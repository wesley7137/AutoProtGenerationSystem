Title: Telomerase reverse transcriptase, a telomere length maintenance protein in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), confers Arabidopsis thaliana seeds aging tolerance via modulation of telomere length.
Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated seed aging, with a particular emphasis on the involvement of reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species diffuse into the nucleus and damage telomeres, resulting in loss of genetic integrity. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) plays an essential role in maintaining plant genomic stability. Genome-wide analyses of TERT genes in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) have not yet been conducted, leaving a gap in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying seed aging associated with TERT genes. In this study, four MsTERT genes were identified in the alfalfa genome. The expression profiles of the four MsTERT genes during seed germination indicated that MS. gene79077 was significantly upregulated by seed aging. Transgenic seeds overexpressing MS. gene79077 in Arabidopsis exhibited enhanced tolerance to seed aging by reducing the levels of H
