Title: Reversible Logic Based Concurrent Error Detection Methodology For
  Emerging Nanocircuits
Abstract:   Reversible logic has promising applications in emerging nanotechnologies,
such as quantum computing, quantum dot cellular automata and optical computing,
etc. Faults in reversible logic circuits that result in multi-bit error at the
outputs are very tough to detect, and thus in literature, researchers have only
addressed the problem of online testing of faults that result single-bit error
at the outputs based on parity preserving logic. In this work, we propose a
methodology for the concurrent error detection in reversible logic circuits to
detect faults that can result in multi-bit error at the outputs. The
methodology is based on the inverse property of reversible logic and is termed
as 'inverse and compare' method. By using the inverse property of reversible
logic, all the inputs can be regenerated at the outputs. Thus, by comparing the
original inputs with the regenerated inputs, the faults in reversible circuits
can be detected. Minimizing the garbage outputs is one of the main goals in
reversible logic design and synthesis. We show that the proposed methodology
results in 'garbageless' reversible circuits. A design of reversible full adder
that can be concurrently tested for multi-bit error at the outputs is
illustrated as the application of the proposed scheme. Finally, we showed the
application of the proposed scheme of concurrent error detection towards fault
detection in quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) emerging nanotechnology.

I.  INTRODUCTION   
Reversible logic is a promising computing paradigm in which  
there is a one -to-one mapping between the input and the 
output vectors. Reversible logic  can help i n realizing 
dissipation  less computing  [19]. The major goal in reversible 
logic design and synthesis is to minimize the number of 
garbage outputs and  the quantum cost . Garbage outputs refer 
to the unutilized outputs that are not used as primary outputs 
and which cannot be used as inputs for  new computation, and 
are only needed  to maintain one -to-one mapping . Reversible 
logic has extensive applications in nanotechnologies , such as 
quantum computing, quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) 
and optical computing . Quantum computing is based on 
reversible gates performing unitary operations, which  are 
reversible in nature  [5]. There are existing works on offline 
testing of reversible logic circuits , the details of which can be 
found in [3, 9 -11]. Recently, concurrent  error detection in  
reversible logic circuits has also attracted the attention of researchers. Concurrent error detection  (CED)  is defined as 
the property of circuits in which faults /errors  can be detected 
at run time while the circuit is performing the no rmal 
operations.  In [1, 2 ], online testing methodologies for 
reversible circuits are proposed that can address online  testing 
of faults that results  in single  bit error  at the outputs of the 
reversible circuits. In [6, 15], the application of  conservative  
reversible logic for concurrent testing of single  
missing/additional cell defect  in quantum dot cellular 
automata circuits  is demonstrated . All these existing works in 
literature are suitable for detection of  faults that result in 
single  bit error  at the o utput of the reversible logic circuits  
[14]. In this work, we propose  a methodology  of concurrent 
error detection in reversible logic circuits based on the inverse 
property of reversible logic  and is called inverse and compare . 
By using the inverse propert y of reversible logic , inputs  can be 
regenerated at the outputs. Thus, the regenerated inputs can be 
compared with the original inputs for concurrent detection of  
fault (permanent or transient in nature)  that result in single bit 
error or multi -bit error at the outputs of the reversible logic 
circuits . We showed that the proposed scheme is  especially 
suitable for reversible logic design  and synthesis  as it 
produce s the ‘garbageless ’ design . Minimization  of the 
garbage outputs  is one of the major goals  in reversible logic 
design and synthesis.  To illustrate the  application s of the  
proposed  inverse  and compare scheme of CED, the design of 
error detectable 1-bit reversible full adder  is illustrated  as an 
example  circuit . Finally, the application of the propose d 
concu rrent error detection strategy  is demonstrated for fault 
detection in QCA emerging nanotechnology  implemented 
using the reversible  logic  gates . 
II.  PROPOSED  SCHEME   OF  CONCURRENT    ERROR 
DETECTION  IN  REVERSIBLE  LOGIC  CIRCUITS  
In the existing wor ks on reversible logic, the parity 
mismatch between the inputs and the outputs is used for 
concurrent error detection. Hence , the existing works are 
limited for single  bit error  at the outputs of the reversible logic 
circuits .  
A. Inverse  and Compare Scheme  
For each reversible gate R that maps each input vector X to 
a unique output vector Y (producing R(X)=Y ),  there also exist 
a inverse reversible gate R’ which maps each input vector Y to 
a unique  output vector X  (producing R’(Y)=X ). Thus, the 
cascading of a  reversible gate with its inverse will regenerate        the inputs. Fig ure 1 shows an example of n inputs  reversible 
gate cascaded with its inverse leading t o regeneration of the 
inputs. The cascading of a reversible logic gate with its inverse 
will minimize the  garbage outputs. This is because 
regeneration of the inputs results in ‘garbageless’  reversible 
circuits as inputs are not considered as garbage signals [4 ]. We 
observed that we can use this property for concurrent detection  
of faults in reversible logic circuits that results in multi -bit 
errors at the output s. It is to be noted that fan -out is not allowed 
in reversible logic. Thus, the fan -out is avoided by using the 
reversible Feynman gate (FG).  Feynman gate is a 2 inputs 2 
outputs reversible gate havin g inputs to outputs mapping as 
P=A and Q= A ⊕B where P and Q are the outputs, and A and 
B are the inputs, respectively [7 ]. Feynman gate is shown in 
Fig. 2.a.  Thus in Feynman gate setting the input B to 0 as 
shown in Fig. 2.b will copy the input A to both the outputs P 
and Q thus avoids the fan -out problem.

Figure 2.  Feynma n gate and its use for avoiding the fan -out  
Figure 3 shows the prop osed concurrent  error detection 
methodology. In Fig.  3, the garbage outputs are directly passed 
to the inverse gate R’ to regenerate the inputs . The primary 
output is  represented by Yk  where 1≤k≤n. H ence, it is passed  
throug h the Feynman gate (FG) to have  the copies of the output 
Yk, so that one copy can be used as the primary output and the 
other copy can be passed to the inverse gate (R’ ) to regenerate 
the input Xk.  Thus, in cas e of faults  in either R or its inverse 
R’ or in both of them, there will be a mismatch between the 
regenerated inputs compared to the original inputs. The 
regenerated inputs can be compared with the original inputs 
using a comparator to detect the faults as sho wn in Fig.3  (the 
comparator is assumed fault free as generally considered in 
redundancy based error detection schemes  [12]). To simplify 
the discussion, we are assuming that FG gates used for 
avoiding the fan -out will be fault tolerant in nature . Further, 
fault can be ea sily detected in Feynman gate because  when 
input B is set to 0 in Feynman gate, input A and outputs P and 
Q should have same value . Any mismatch in the values of 
input A and the outputs P and Q  when input B=0,   will result in 
fault detection  in the Feynman gate. Almost all 
nanotechnologies except quantum computing that have  
applications of reversible logic allows the fan -out, so Feynman 
gates will not be required in those nanotechnologies  to copy 
the useful outputs . Thus the proposed scheme  provides the ‘garbageless’ reversible logic circuits with the  primary  
advantage of concurrent error detection.    
B. Comparison of  the proposed scheme of Concurrent  
Error Detection With Duplication Based Approach  
The duplicate and the  compare scheme  that is  widely used in 
literature for concurrent error detection  has the limitation that 
the it won’t work for the cases in which both the monitored as 
well as the duplicated circuit have the identical errors  [12]. In 
this case errors can go unnoticed. The invers e and compare 
scheme will be beneficial in this case as it can also detect the 
errors when the monitored as well  as th e inverse  circuit have 
the identical errors. This is because in the inverse and compare 
scheme we regenerate the inputs so errors in eithe r montiored 
or inverse  circuit or in both of them cannot go unnoticed.   
Further, since the proposed scheme results in garbageless 
reversible circuits it is especially suitable for reversible 
computing as the primary goal in reversible logic design and 
synthesis is to minimize the number of garbage outputs.

III. EXAMPLE OF  CONCURREN T ERROR DETECTION IN  
REVERSIBLE FULL ADDER  
We d emonstrate the application of the proposed approach of  
concurrent  error detection to design a concurrently testable 
reversible ful l adder in w hich multi -bit error  at the outputs  can 
be detected.  In [2], a 4x4 (4 inputs: 4 outputs) reversible gate  
called O TG gate shown in Fig. 4  is proposed. The truth table 
of the OTG gate is shown in Table I . OTG gate has the 
quantum cost of 6 since it is designed from 6  2x2 rev ersible 
gates as shown in Fig. 5 .  The quantum cost of a reversible 
gate is the number of 1x1 an d 2x2 reversible gates or quantum 
logic gates required in designing it. The quantum cost of all 
reversible  1x1 and 2x2 gates is taken as unity [6 ].  Thus any 
reversible gate is realized by using  1x1 NOT gate, and 2x2 
reversible gates such as V and V+ (V is a square -root-of N OT 
gate and V+ is its hermitian)  and Feynman gate which is also 
known as  Controlled NOT gate (CNOT). In simple terms, the 
quantum cost of a reversible gate can be calculated by 
counting the number of V, V+ and CNOT gates used in imple menting it except in few cases. More details on quantum 
cost calculation can be found in [18 ]. 
     OTG gate has the special property that it can work singly as 
a reversibl e full adder as shown in Fig. 6 . A reversible full 
adder can be designed using OTG g ate with the quantum cost 
of 6, and 2 garbage outputs. We are demonstrating the 
application of the proposed approach to design a concurrently 
testable reversi ble full adder in which multi -bit errors at the 
outputs can be detected. This requires a 4x4 rever sible gate that 
can work as the inverse of the OTG gate.  We called the 
inverse of the OTG gate as the IOTG gate.  In order to derive 
the logic equations of the IOTG gate, we performed the reverse 
mapping of the OTG gate outputs working as inputs to the 
IOTG gate. This will regenerate the inputs of the OTG gate at 
the outputs of the IOTG gate leading to the truth ta ble of the 
IOTG shown in Table II . From the truth table, we derived the 
logical input and output mapping o f the IOTG gate shown in 
Fig. 7 .  Figure 8 shows the proposed quantum implementation 
of the IOTG gate which concludes that the IOTG gate has the 
quantum cost of 6.

Figure 9  shows the proposed design of 1 bit reversible full 
adder by combining the OTG gate and the IOTG gate  in which 
multi -bit error  at the output can be concurrently detected. In 
Fig. 9 , Feynman gates (FG) are used to avoid the fan -out.  It 
can be seen that the inputs to OTG gate are regenerated at the 
outputs of IOTG gate. The proposed approach of concurrent 
error detection is compared with the existing approach in 
literature [1] that works for single -bit error at the output . The 
online testing methodology in [1] is based on a combination of R1 gate along with R2 gate (a 4*4 Feynman Ga te). R1 gate is 
shown in Fig. 10 , and to the best of our knowledge the 
quantum cost of R1 gate is not known.  We computed the 
lower bound on the quantum cost of R1 gate. We can see from 
the output equations of the R1 gate that there a re 7 independent 
XOR operations and 2 independent AND operations. XOR 
operation which are counted once and are also used in other 
places is not counted multiple times, for example, P=A ⊕C and 
R=A⊕B⊕C will have only 2 XOR operations as R can be 
computed as R =P⊕B. Each XOR operation can be designed 
by a 2x2 Feynman gate which has the quantum cost of 1, thus 
R1 gate will have a minimum quantum cost of 7. T he 
minimum quantum cost of testable block formed by R1 gate 
and R2 gate (4x4 Feynman gate) will be 7+3=10, which is the 
summation of the quantum cost of R1 gate and 4x4 Feynman 
gate.  
In the delay computation, we have taken the delay of each 
reversible gate as 1 unit which is fair for comparison purpose 
as the IOTG and OTG gates are computationally less comp lex 
compared to R1 gate. Table III  shows the comparison of the 
proposed design of concurrently testable reversible full adder 
shown in Fig. 13 with the testable full adder design proposed in 
[1]. The results shows the significant improvement of 50%, 
100%, 62.5 % and 33.33% in terms of number of reversible 
gates, garbage outputs, unit delay and quantum cost, 
respectively, compared to the design in [1]. Further, our 
approach has the primary advantage of concurrent detection  of 
multi -bit errors at the outputs .

 IV. APPLICATION TO EMERGING  NANOTECHNOL OGIES  
To demonstrate the application of the proposed approach of 
concurrent error  detection in emerging nanotechnologies, we 
choose quantum dot cellular aut omata (QCA) nanotechnology 
as an example since reversible logic has potential applications 
in QCA computing [6, 15 ]. Quantum dot cellular automata 
(QCA) is one of the emerging nanotechnologies in which it is 
possible to achieve circuit densities and clock frequencies 
much beyond the limit of existing CMOS technology.  QCA 
has significant advantage in terms of power dissipation as it 
does not have to dissipate all its signal energy hence 
considered as one of the promising technologies to achieve the 
thermody namic limit of computation . The basic QCA logic 
devices comprise the majority voter (MV), the inverter (INV), 
binary wire and the inverter chain  [8, 16] .   
 
A. Reversible gates in QCA Computing  
QCA computing is based on  majority voting, thus recently two 
new 3x3 (3 inputs: 3 outputs)  reversible gates QCA1 and 
QCA2 suitable for majority based QCA computin g are 
proposed [ 13].  The reversible  QCA1  gate can be described as 
mapping (A, B, C) to (P=MV(A,B,C), Q=MV(A,B,C’), 
R=MV(A’,B,C), where A, B, C are inputs and P, Q, R are 
outputs, respectively.  The reversible QCA2  gate  can be  
described as mapping (A, B, C) to (P=MV(A,B,C), 
Q=MV(A,B,C’), R=MV(A’,B,C’), where A, B, C are inputs 
and P, Q, R are outputs, respectively. Figure 11  shows the 
QCA1 and QCA 2 gates.    Since QCA1  and QCA2 are most 
useful for QCA computing once we have  the inverse of QCA1 
and QCA2 gates , the proposed method of concur rent error 
detection can be applied to QCA computing.  In this work, we 
have called the inverse of QCA1 gate as IQCA1 , while th e 
inverse of QCA2 gate is called  IQCA2.

Figure 11.  QCA1 and QCA 2 reversible gates  [13] 
 
 
B. Proposed Inverse QCA1 gate (IQCA1) and Inverse QCA2 
(IQCA2) ga tes  
In order to derive the inverse of QCA1 gate (IQCA1) we used 
the truth table of QCA1 gate.  The truth table of th e QCA1 
gate is shown in Table IV.   From Table IV , we derive the 
truth table of t he IQCA1 gate as shown in Table V.  From 
Table V , IQCA1 ca n be described as mapping (P, Q, R) to 
(A=MV(P,Q,R’), B=MV(P,Q,R), C=MV(P,Q’,R), where P, Q, R are inputs and A, B, C are o utputs, respectively.  Figure 12 
illustrates the IQCA1 gate.   Similarly for deriving the inverse 
of QCA2 gate (IQCA2 ), we used the tr uth table of QCA2 gate 
and derived the IQCA2 logic equations  as mapping (P, Q, R) 
to (A=MV(P,Q,R’), B=MV(P,Q,R), C=MV(P,Q’,R’), where 
P, Q, R are input and A, B, C are output, respectively.  Figure 
13 shows the IQCA2 reversible gate.  
     Once we have th e inverse of QCA1 and QCA2 gates, they 
can be cascaded with them, respectively, to regenerate the 
inputs for concurrent err or detection of multi -bit error  at the 
outputs in  QCA computing. In Fig. 14, an example of the 
proposed approach is shown for QCA com puting by 
combining Q CA1 and IQCA1 together . In QCA computing, 
fan-out is allowed; hence in Fig.14  we don’t require the 
Feynman gates in the design to avoid the fan -out problem. 
Thus, implementing a reversible gate in QCA and cascading 
with its inverse wil l result in concurrent detection of faults in 
QCA circuits. The proposed methodology is independent of 
the reversible gate. Thus any reversible gate along with its 
inverse implemented in QCA technology can be used for 
concurrent detection of multiple fault s in QCA circuits.  We 
want to emphasize a very special characteristic of the 
proposed approach of concurrent testing  based  on reversible 
logic for  QCA  computing . By cascading a reversible logic 
gate with its inverse will result  in dissipation less QCA cir cuit, 
as all inputs are regenerated  that results  in no information 
loss [17].

V. CONCLUSIONS  
We have demonstrated a new methodology of concurrent error 
detection in reversible logic circuits. The proposed strategy is  
based on the inver se property of reversible logic  that helps in 
the regeneration of the inputs .  This results in detection of 
multi -bit errors at the outputs by comparing the original inputs 
with the regenerated inputs . The inverse and the compare scheme will be able to detect all types of faults in reversible 
logic circuits. The proposed methodology of concurrent error 
detection based on property of reversible logic is generic in 
nature, and will be applicable to any emerging 
nanotechnology, such as QCA, nano -CMOS designs, which 
may be susceptible to single or multiple transient and 
permanent faults .  An application of the proposed approach for 
concurrent error detection in emerging technologies is 
illustrated   for  QCA nanotechnology .
