Title: Growth and Scaling during Development and Regeneration
Abstract:   Life presents fascinating examples of self-organization and emergent
phenomena. In multi-cellular organisms, a multitude of cells interact to form
and maintain highly complex body plans of well-defined size. In this thesis, we
investigate theoretical feedback mechanisms for both self-organized body plan
patterning and size control.
  The thesis is inspired by the astonishing scaling and regeneration abilities
of flatworms. These worms can perfectly regrow their entire body plan even from
tiny amputation fragments like the tip of the tail. Moreover, they can grow and
actively de-grow by more than a factor of 40 in length depending on feeding
conditions. These capabilities prompt for remarkable physical mechanisms of
self-organized pattern formation and scaling.
  First, we explore the basic principles and challenges of pattern scaling in
mechanisms previously proposed to describe biological pattern formation. Next,
we present a novel class of patterning mechanisms yielding entirely
self-organized and self-scaling patterns. This framework captures essential
features of body plan regeneration and scaling in flatworms. Further, we
analyze shape and motility of flatworms. By applying principal component
analysis, we characterize shape dynamics during different motility modes and
also identify shape variations between different flatworm species. Finally, we
investigate the metabolic control of cell turnover and growth. We identify
three mechanisms of metabolic energy storage; theoretical descriptions thereof
can explain the measured organism growth by rules on the cellular scale.
  In a close collaboration with experimental biologists, we combine minimal
theoretical descriptions with state-of-the-art experiments and data analysis.
This allows us to identify generic principles of scalable body plan patterning
and growth control in flatworms.

Life presents fascinating examples of self-organization and emergent phenomena. In
multi-cellular organisms, a multitude of cells interact to form and maintain highly complex body
plans. This requires reliable communication between cells on various length scales. First, there
has to be the right number of cells to preserve the integrity of the body and its size. Second,
there have to be the right types of cells at the right positions to result in a functional body
layout. In this thesis, we investigate theoretical feedback mechanisms for both self-organized
body plan patterning and size control.
The thesis is inspired by the astonishing scaling and regeneration abilities of at-
worms. These worms can perfectly regrow their entire body plan even from tiny amputation
fragments like the tip of the tail. Moreover, they can grow and actively de-grow by more than a
factor of 40 in length depending on feeding conditions, scaling up and down all body parts while
maintaining their functionality. These capabilities prompt for remarkable physical mechanisms
of pattern formation.
First, we explore pattern scaling in mechanisms previously proposed to describe
biological pattern formation. We systematically extract requirements for scaling and high-
light the limitations of these previous models in their ability to account for growth and regene-
ration in atworms. In particular, we discuss a prominent model for the spontaneous formation
of biological patterns introduced by Alan Turing. We characterize the hierarchy of steady states
of such a Turing mechanism and demonstrate that Turing patterns do not naturally scale.
Second, we present a novel class of patterning mechanisms yielding entirely self-
organized and self-scaling patterns. Our framework combines a Turing system with our
derived principles of pattern scaling and thus captures essential features of body plan regenera-
tion and scaling in atworms. We deduce general signatures of pattern scaling using dynamical
systems theory. These signatures are discussed in the context of experimental data.
Next, we analyze shape and motility of atworms. By monitoring worm motility, we can
identify movement phenotypes upon gene knockout, reporting on patterning defects in the lo-
comotory system. Furthermore, we adapt shape mode analysis to study 2D body deformations
of wildtype worms, which enables us to characterize two main motility modes: a smooth gliding
mode due to the beating of their cilia and an inchworming behavior based on muscle contrac-
tions. Additionally, we apply this technique to investigate shape variations between dierent
atworm species. With this approach, we aim at relating form and function in atworms.
Finally, we investigate the metabolic control of cell turnover and growth. We estab-
lish a protocol for accurate measurements of growth dynamics in atworms. We discern three
mechanisms of metabolic energy storage; theoretical descriptions thereof can explain the ob-
served organism growth by rules on the cellular scale. From this, we derive specic predictions
to be tested in future experiments.
In a close collaboration with experimental biologists, we combine minimal theoret-
ical descriptions with state-of-the-art experiments and data analysis. This allows us
to identify generic principles of scalable body plan patterning and growth control in atworms.
iZusammenfassung auf Deutsch
Die belebte Natur bietet uns zahlreiche faszinierende Beispiele f ur die Ph anomene
von Selbstorganisation und Emergenz. In Vielzellern interagieren Millionen von Zellen
miteinander und sind dadurch in der Lage komplexe K orperformen auszubilden und zu unter-
halten. Dies verlangt noch einer zuverl assigen Kommunikation zwischen den Zellen auf ver-
schiedenen L angenskalen. Einerseits ist stets eine bestimmte Zellanzahl erforderlich, sodass der
Korper intakt bleibt und seine Gr osse erh alt. Anderseits muss f ur einen funktionst uchtigen
Korper aber auch der richtige Zelltyp an der richtigen Stelle zu nden sein. In der vorliegenden
Dissertation untersuchen wir beide Aspekte, die Kontrolle von Wachstum sowie die selbstor-
ganisierte Ausbildung des K orperbaus.
Die Dissertation ist inspiriert von den erstaunlichen Skalierungs- und Regene-
rationsf ahigkeiten von Plattw urmern. Diese W urmer k onnen ihren K orper selbst aus
winzigen abgetrennten Fragmenten { wie etwa der Schwanzspitze { komplett regenerieren.
Daruberhinaus k onnen sie auch, je nach F utterungsbedingung, um mehr als das 40fache in der
Lange wachsen oder schrumpfen und passen dabei alle K orperteile entsprechend an, wobei deren
Funktionalit at erhalten bleibt. Diese F ahigkeiten verlangen nach bemerkenswerten physikali-
schen Musterbildungsmechanismen.
Zunachst untersuchen wir das Skalierungsverhalten von fr uheren Ans atzen zur
Beschreibung biologischer Musterbildung. Wir leiten daraus Voraussetzung f ur das
Skalieren ab und zeigen auf, dass die bekannten Modelle nur begrenzt auf Wachstum und
Regeneration von Plattw urmern angewendet werden k onnen. Insbesondere diskutieren wir
ein wichtiges Modell f ur die spontane Entstehung von biologischen Strukturen, das von Alan
Turing vorgeschlagen wurde. Wir charakterisieren die Hierarchie von station aren Zust anden
solcher Turing Mechanismen und veranschaulichen, dass diese Turingmuster nicht ohne weiteres
skalieren.
Daraufhin pr asentieren wir eine neuartige Klasse von Musterbildungsmechanis-
men, die vollst andig selbstorgansierte und selbstskalierende Muster erzeugen. Unser
Ansatz vereint ein Turing System mit den zuvor hergeleiteten Prinzipien f ur das Skalieren von
Mustern und beschreibt dadurch wesentliche Aspekte der Regeneration und Skalierung von
Plattw urmern. Mit Hilfe der Theorie dynamischer Systeme leiten wir allgemeine Merkmale von
skalierenden Mustern ab, die wir im Hinblick auf experimentelle Daten diskutieren.
Als n achstes analysieren wir Form und Fortbewegung der W urmer. Die Auswer-
tung des Bewegungsverhaltens, nachdem einzelne Gene ausgeschaltet wurden, erm oglicht R uck-
schlussse auf die Bedeutung dieser Gene f ur den Bewegungsapparat. Dar uber hinaus wenden
wir eine Hauptkomponentenanalyse auf die Verformungen des zweidimensionalen Wurmk orpers
wahrend der nat urlichen Fortbewegung an. Damit sind wir in der Lage, zwei wichtige Fortbe-
wegungsstrategien der W urmer zu charakterisieren: eine durch den Zilienschlag angetriebene
gleichm assige Gleitbewegung und eine raupenartige Bewegung, die auf Muskelkontraktionen
beruht. Zus atzlich wenden wir diese Analysetechnik auch an, um Unterschiede in der Gestalt
von verschiedenen Plattwurmarten zu untersuchen. Grunds atzlich zielen alle diese Ans atze da-
rauf ab, das Aussehen der Plattw urmer mit den damit verbundenen Funktionen verschiedener
Korperteile in Beziehung zu setzen.
iiSchlussendlich erforschen wir den Einuss des Stowechsels auf den Zellaustausch
und das Wachstum. Dazu etablieren wir Messungen der Wachstumsdynamik in Plattw urmern.
Wir unterscheiden drei Mechanismen f ur das Speichern von Stowechselenergie, deren theoreti-
sche Beschreibung es uns erm oglicht, das beobachtete makroskopische Wachstum des Organis-
mus mit dem Verhalten der einzelnen Zellen zu erkl aren. Basierend darauf leiten wir Vorher-
sagen ab, die nun experimentell getestet werden.
In enger Zusammenarbeit mit Kollegen aus der experimentellen Biologie f uhren wir
minimale theoretische Beschreibungen mit modernsten Experimenten und Analyse-
techniken zusammen. Dadurch sind wir in der Lage, Grundlagen sowohl der skalierbaren
Ausbildung des K orperbaus als auch der Wachstumskontrolle bei Plattw urmern herauszuar-
beiten.

ix1. Introduction
1.1. Development, growth and regeneration
The world around us is populated by a great variety of organisms of very dierent
shapes, sizes and levels of complexity. Many of the most complex organisms, including
“Cell and tissue, shell and bone, leaf and ﬂower,
... Their problems of form are in the ﬁrst in-
stance mathematical problems, their problems of
growth are essentially physical problems, and the
morphologist is, ipso facto, a student of physical
science.” — D’Arcy W. Thompson, On Growth
and Form, 1945 (217)humans, develop from a single fertilized egg cell,
see Fig. 1.1(a). The egg divides multiple times
to give rise to the many cells that form the dif-
ferent tissues of the adult organism (68, 244).
This embryonic development results in a well-
dened body plan of the organism, which eventu-
ally can reproduce again. One important aspect
of development is growth , i.e. the increase in organism size. The growth at the scale of
the organism follows from processes at the cellular scale: (i) an increase in cell number
by cell division, (ii) an increase in cell size by cellular growth and (iii) an increase in
the extra-cellular material (244).
During most of its lifetime, an organism maintains shape and function of its body,
despite the fact that cells continuously become damaged and get lost (68, 158, 244).
Thishomeostasis requires the sustained addition of new cells by cell division as well
as mechanisms of controlled cell death such as apoptosis. Importantly, the turnover
processes have to be well orchestrated at the cell, tissue and organism level. Imperfect
homeostasis results in aging of the organism (158).
Furthermore, many organisms can regenerate after injury to some extent, see Fig. 1.1(b)
(68, 184, 244). Regeneration refers to de-novo formation of large parts of tissues and
organs that have been damaged or lost. In contrast to embryonic development, which
comprises a xed sequence of morphogenetic events starting from the fertilized egg as
a well-dened initial condition, the starting point of regeneration strongly depends on
the injury and is thus variable. It is a major question to what extent both processes
are guided by the same principles and depend on the same mechanisms (184).
The ability to reproduce and the permanent struggle against decay are important cha-
racteristics of life in general (192). We are only beginning to understand the respective

which the body plan emerges and grows to its nal size. (b) Many multi-cellular

processes of development, growth and regeneration in simple model systems with the
help of modern molecular biology. In this thesis, we combine minimal theoretical de-
scriptions with the analysis of biological data in atworms as model systems in order
to extract fundamental physical principles for body plan patterning and growth control
in multicellular organisms.
1.1.1. From cells to tissues to organisms
The question of how an organism forms has puzzled natural philosophers and researchers
for more than two millennia. It was Aristotle who performed one of the earliest do-
cumented experiments in developmental biology in 350 BC (68, 216, 244). He opened
chicken eggs at various time intervals after fertilization and observed that the embryo
gradually resembles a chicken. The gradual formation of an organism, called epige-
nesis , was confronted with the alternative hypothesis of preformation (68, 244). The
latter assumes a completely pre-formed miniature body, which then only grows. De-
spite the work of Aristotle, the theory of preformation was still prevalent in Europe
until the 18th century and is embodied in the idea of the \homunculus", the tiny version
21.1 Development, growth and regeneration
of a person encapsulated in the sperm cell (68, 228, 244). Later a related discussion
arose about the concepts of pre-encoded and emergent complexity, as will be mentioned
below (188).
The basic building blocks of higher order organisms are the cells, which come at very
dierent shapes and sizes (68, 244). For example, a muscle cell and a blood cell have a
completely dierent appearance and very dierent properties but they both originate
from a single egg cell, which has divided many times to give rise to all the cells of
the body (68, 244). The cells become committed to fulll specic tasks and change
their properties during the process of dierentiation . Uncommitted cells that can
dierentiate into other cell types are called stem cells . Often, there are also tissue-
specic stem cells that are already partially committed and can only turn into a subset
of cell types. In some organisms, dierentiated cells are able to de-dierentiate into less
committed cells (15, 214).
During embryonic development and regeneration, cells dierentiate and organize in a
position dependent manner to form a well-dened body plan. Most modern animals
areBilaterians , characterized by three main body axis, see Fig. 1.2(a): the anterior-
posterior axis from tail to head, the dorso-ventral axis from the front to the backside
and a mirror symmetric medio-lateral axis (141). Yet, how is the cellular behavior
choreographed with respect to this internal coordinate system?
With the advancements in light microscopy and the ability to observe microscopic
structures, biologists could address this question and perform experiments, in which
they selectively perturbed a specic part of an organism in order to reveal its functions
in body plan patterning (42, 68, 108, 125, 128, 244). As a result, biological research
changed from a descriptive to an experimental science. Here, we will highlight three
early experiments by Chabry, Driesch and Morgan to discuss important concepts of
morphogenesis.
Chabry selectively killed individual cells in the early embryo of the marine invertebrate
Tunicate after the rst or second cell division with a needle. In consequence, only
certain parts of the organism developed, depending on which cells he had destroyed
(68, 188). The results were later conrmed by completely removing the two muscle
precursor cells of the 8-cell embryo (68, 241). These separated cells became muscle
cells by themselves, while the remaining embryo was lacking the muscles. Driesch
performed a similar experiment in sea-urchins but obtained completely opposite results
(42). He separated the two cells after the rst round of cell division and observed that
a single cell can develop into a perfectly patterned organism, just of a smaller size.

on pre-encoded structures (exemplied by purple cells forming the head), self-organized
formation of a body plan as an emergent phenomenon based on mutual interactions
between cells.
At the same time, Morgan was performing various regeneration experiments especially
with the freshwater polyp Hydra and atworms, and he reported that these animals
could re-grow perfectly patterned heads, tails and other body parts after amputation
(128).
These observations can be discussed in the light of two fundamental concepts of mor-
phogenesis, see Fig. 1.2(b) (68, 188): First, the theory of self-dierentiation (or mosaic
development) builds on the idea of a pre-encoded (hidden) complexity in the early par-
titioning of the tissue that then only enfolds. Second, the converse theory (sometimes
called conditional specication) considers complexity of the body plan as an emergent
phenomenon by the interaction of dierent parts. Today, we begin to appreciate that
embryonic development combines both paradigms. The second one has the appeal to
account for regeneration in a natural fashion and will be studied in this thesis in the
context of self-organized body plan patterning.
1.1.2. Cellular communication and chemical signals
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the existence of \forma-
tive substances" was postulated to control cell fate during development and regenera-
tion (128, 129, 174, 188). It was proposed that these substances are found in graded
abundance originating from the animal poles as the organizing centers and that they
determine polarity and growth of an organism by controlling the cellular behavior
(128, 129, 174). Related concepts were built on a \physiological gradient", inspired
for example by the fact that the regenerative capability in some atworm species varies
along the body axis from head to tail (36).
41.1 Development, growth and regeneration
These considerations lead to the notion of morphogens as specic signaling molecules
that are secreted in distinct source regions and spread in the tissue. The morphogen
concentrations provide chemical cues that control division and dierentiation of cells
(68, 79, 138, 244). The term was originally coined by Turing, who proposed a purely
theoretical mechanism for the spontaneous emergence of chemical patterns as a tem-
plate for the body plan layout (221). As a complementary theoretical approach, it
was discussed how a pre-existing organizing region can instruct tissue patterning by
secretion of morphogens (174, 243). It was proposed that graded concentration proles
provide cells with the information about their position within the tissue. We will dis-
cuss a well-known illustration of this idea, the French ag model, in Section 1.3. Next,
we provide biological examples for organizing regions and concentration gradients of
signaling molecules.
Early experiments by Mangold and Spemann found evidence for an organizing region
that instructs body plan patterning in the embryo of the frog Xenopus laevis (204).
When transplanting the now so-called Spemann organizer into another frog embryo,
the latter developed a second perfectly patterned head. Furthermore, experimental
evidence for \organizing substances" at the animal poles was found in leaf hoppers
(100, 186, 187). After splitting the embryo in a head and a tail fragment, in most cases
neither part developed normally. Yet, if substances from the tail tip were moved to
the head fragment, the head fragment developed into a complete embryo. Interestingly,
also the tail fragment developed further, indicating a concentration-dependent eect of
these tail substances.
Pioneering work by N usslein-Volhard and colleagues could identify the protein Bicoid
as a signaling molecule in the embryo of the fruit y Drosophila melanogaster and
demonstrated its instructive role in tissue patterning, see Fig. 1.3(a) (45, 52, 56). They
also visualized its graded concentration prole decreasing from the anterior tip, which
could be tted by an exponential function (43, 44). Additionally, they showed that
Bicoid inuences cellular behavior in a concentration-dependent manner (44).
There are several key signaling systems for patterning and growth control that are
widespread across the animal kingdom. Prominent examples belong to the Transform-
ing growth factor (TGF-) superfamily and to the Wnt family. TGF- proteins can
be found in a wide range of organisms from simple worms to mammals. They control
growth, patterning, tissue homeostasis and even the immune system (88). In this thesis,
we will encounter four examples of these proteins: Activin in the clawed frog Xenopus
(72, 75, 80) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) in the fruit y (5, 109, 205, 234), see Fig. 1.3(b),

as well as Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) and Anti-dorsalizing morphogenic pro-
tein (Admp) in atworms (4, 61). Also Wnt family members are found in organisms
from invertebrates to humans (9, 40, 107, 141, 144, 164). The name is a portmanteau
of Wingless (the corresponding protein in the fruit y), and Integration 1 (the homolog
originally identied in mammal cancer research). These proteins control the division,
dierentiation and migration of cells as well as the specication of the main body axes.
In this thesis, we especially consider the head-tail polarity in atworms associated with
Wnts.
1.1.3. From signals to genes and back
The function of a cell is largely determined by the proteins inside (244). There are
several classes of proteins. Housekeeping proteins for the maintenance of the basic
cellular functions such as protein synthesis, structural support and cell metabolism are
present in all cells under physiological conditions. Other proteins are only found in
certain types of cells and are involved in specic tasks such as division, developmental
signaling, force generation, sensory perception or immune responses.
The blueprint for all proteins is chemically encoded in the genome . The genome
consists of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) macromolecules, in which characteristic base
pair sequences (genes) represent the proteins. This genetic information can be read out
from the DNA strands by a gene expression pathway as depicted in Fig. 1.4(a). First,
the DNA unfolds at the respective gene site and the gene sequence is successively copied

Figure 1.4.: (a) Gene expression: proteins are synthesized by transcribing the genetic
information saved in the DNA to mRNA molecules, which then act as a blueprint
for the protein. (b) Gene expression can be activated or de-activated by signaling
molecules (here exemplied for canonical Wnt signaling). In the absence of Wnt
molecules, -catenin is tagged for degradation by a destruction complex, which in-
cludes Axin, Adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)
and Casein kinase 1 (CK1). If Wnt is bound to the Frizzled receptors and the
Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6), the formation of
the destruction complex is suppressed and -catenin can translocate to the nucleus to
act as a co-activator of various genes (68, 143, 244).
to a messenger ribonucleic acid strand (mRNA) during a process called transcription .
Again a sequence of nitrogenous bases encodes the specic protein. Second, during
translation , the mRNA acts as a template for protein synthesis with the help of
ribosomes (i.e. large complexes consisting of proteins and RNA strands).
All somatic cells (with a few exceptions) are genetically equivalent because they all
stem from the same initial egg cell. During cell division, the DNA becomes duplicated
and one copy remains in each daughter cell (68, 244). The cells acquire dierent fates
if dierent genes are activated and thus dierent proteins are present in the cells.
This activation of genes is in turn also controlled by signaling molecules. Fig. 1.4(b)
illustrates the signaling cascade of canonical Wnts as an example. In the absence of
Wnt molecules, -catenin is tagged for degradation by a destruction complex involving
several molecules such as Adenomatous poluposis coli (APC) and Axin. Upon binding
of Wnt molecules to the Frizzled receptors and co-receptors (LRP5/6), Axin is recruited
to the membrane and the formation of the destruction complex is suppressed. Thus,
-catenin can accumulated and reach the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription
co-activator for specic target genes. In eect, Wnt has an activating eect on the
expression of these target genes.
The resulting proteins can fulll certain tasks for the cell in which they have been
71. INTRODUCTION
synthesized, yet they can also be released and act as morphogens to activate or de-
activate parts of the genome in other cells. This realizes positive and negative feedback
loops, from which complex cellular signaling networks are built.
1.1.4. Gene expression can be modied in experiments
Experimentalists can interfere with the synthesis of specic proteins by exploiting the
control and error correction machinery of the cells, which ensures robustness of the
important processes of DNA duplication, transcription and translation and modies
their outcome (68). One such mechanism is RNA interference (RNAi), for which small
interfering RNA (siRNA) pieces are used by the cell to target specic mRNA strands,
mainly for destruction (6). For example, this can be an immune response against exoge-
nous RNA introduced by viruses. Similarly, experimentalists can articially suppress
a protein of choice by introducing a RNA sequence for this protein in the cell. Such
RNAi techniques are applied to obtain some of the data presented in this thesis.
1.2. Flatworms as a model organism for scaling, growth and
regeneration
Classic experiments on atworm regeneration already inspired the idea of morpho-
genetic gradients (36, 128, 129). In recent years, the atworm Schmidtea mediterranea
(Smed ) has become increasingly popular as a model organism to study regeneration and
growth, aging, and even behavior (63, 140, 151, 158, 162, 179, 183, 198, 212). There
are many dierent atworm species populating very diverse habitats all around the
world. They are found in saltwater, in freshwater and in the soil; some live more than
1000 m under the sea and some parasitic species (like ukes and tapeworms) in the
body of other organisms (151, 170, 179, 202). Smed is a non-parasitic atworm living
in freshwater. Such free-living species are sometimes also referred to as \planarians"
(50).
Flatworms (Greek: Platyhelminthes ) bridge the gap between other model organisms
of lower complexity such as the freshwater polyp Hydra and the C. elegans worm and
those of higher complexity, such as fruit y, clawed frog, axolotl, zebrash and mouse
(184, 244), see Fig. 1.5. Many members of the atworm phylum seem to represent the
most evolved organisms that are still able to regenerate any part of their body (50, 128,
140, 184). For example, Smed can restore its complete body plan from amputation

Figure 1.5.: Flatworms are the most complex model organisms that can still regene-
rate every tissue. This regeneration capability is shared with simpler organisms such as
Hydra . At the same time, atworms possess organ systems like a centralized nervous
system and two distinct brain lobes, which are characteristic for the most complex
organisms (50, 68, 128, 140, 143, 184, 244).
fragments as tiny as the very tip of the tail with only about 104cells (126). By
re-growing missing body parts and re-modeling oversized organs, they recover their
normal shape scaled to the size of the amputation fragment within 1-2 weeks (4, 170).
This astonishing regeneration capability is comparable to the much simpler Hydra and
distinguishes atworms from other model organisms with much less body plan plasticity
(158, 184).
Thereby, the body plan of Smed shows already key characteristics that are usually asso-
ciated with higher order organisms (140), see Fig. 1.6. The bilaterally symmetric Smed
possess a central nervous system with a distinct bilobed brain and two ventral nerve
cords connected by commissural neurons (69, 95, 165, 170, 171, 183). The sensory sys-
tem processes information from chemo-, rheo- and photorecetors leading to a complex
behavioral repertoire (69, 95, 153, 171). Their usual mode of motility is a gliding motion
on a secreted layer of mucus being propelled by the beating of numerous short agella
(or cilia) that project from their multi-ciliated ventral epithelium (8, 169, 179, 180).
However the worms also use the numerous muscles situated along their inner body wall
for (i) steering, (ii) quick escape responses, (ii) exploratory head motion and (iv) a
back-up movement strategy (152, 153, 169, 180, 220).

Figure 1.6.: The body plan of the atworm Schmidtea mediterranea (Smed ) shows
already key characteristics that are usually associated with higher order organisms
(37, 51, 171, 173, 231, 245).
Smed belong to the taxon Tricladida , which is reected by the fact that their highly
ramied gut splits in three main branches (69, 140, 165, 170), see Fig. 1.6(b). During
feeding, the carnivorous worms suck in food through their extensible pharynx opening.
After digestion, the pharynx also functions as an anus for excretion. Protonephridia
constitute a further part of the excretory system, which performs similar functions as
the kidneys in humans (171).
Turnover, growth and regneration completely relies on a pool of stem cells called
neoblasts. The fraction of neoblasts among all cells had been estimated to be as large
as 25 35% (15, 16, 17, 18). If the worms are depleted of all neoblasts by -irradiation,
they will show a regression of the body starting from the head and nally they fall
apart (15, 46, 159, 170). The time scale until the decay sets in varies between species
in the range from several days to a few weeks (46, 159). This indicates that there is no
de-dierentiation of cells to restore the stem cell pool. A subpopulation of neoblasts
is pluripotent (and maybe even totipotent) and can develop into every other cell type
(15, 63, 84, 140, 158, 170). Wagner et al. have shown that irradiated worms can be res-
cued by transplanting a single pluripotent neoblast from an intact worm (229). Even
though neoblasts are well dened by their progression through the cell cycle resul-
ting in cell division, there is increasing evidence that the neoblast population is not
101.2 Flatworms as a model organism for scaling, growth and regeneration
homogeneous (85, 132, 194, 225). Most likely, they also comprise lineage-restricted
subpopulations and transiently amplifying cells that go through a few more rounds of
cell division during dierentiation.
Smed show both sexual and asexual reproduction (48, 140, 170, 183). Some strains are
hermaphrodites, which develop testes and ovaries symmetrically along their body axis
as well as copulatory organs for cross-fertilization, see Fig. 1.6(c). In contrast, asexual

— Joachim Ringelnatz, Abseits der Geogra-
phie, 1924 (168)strains do not possess a reproductive system and
reproduce by ssioning: the worm attaches its tail
to the substrate and glides on until the body is
ripped into two or more pieces, which develop into
new worms after regeneration (140). Fissioning
depends strongly on the environmental conditions,
in particular on temperature, feeding, light and
worm density (48, 131, 140, 161). For example,
ssioning frequency is reduced in crowded envi-
ronments. Like regeneration abilities, reproduction strategies also vary widely among
atworm species (50). In particular, one observes various approaches to asexual repro-
duction. Some species like Smed rst split and regenerate afterwards, others already
grow the respective organs of the new body plan before ssioning. The second stra-
tegy comes in two forms: as paratomy with the new body aligned to the old axis and
budding with a non-aligned outgrowth at the side or pointing backward.
Smed are well-suited model organisms to study growth and cell turnover. First, all
somatic cells are continuously replaced by cell turnover at a time scale of weeks (158,
170). Second, growth and cell turnover rely completely on the division of a large
population of neoblasts, some of which are pluripotent (15, 63, 85, 140, 158, 170). Third,
depending on feeding conditions, the worms can grow and actively shrink (usually
referred to as \degrow"), while scaling their body plan over more than one order of
magnitude in length in the range of 0.5 mm to 2 cm (140, 151, 170), see Fig. 1.7(a).
Active degrowth enables the worms to survive long starvation periods of several months.
It has been suggested that worms recycle apoptotic material during degrowth to fuel
the metabolism of the remaining cells (69, 70).
Smed are also well-suited to study scalable patterning during growth and regeneration.
Being able to reversibly grow by a factor of 40 in length and perfectly regenerate
even from scrambled body fragments prompts for patterning mechanisms that are not
only highly robust and self-organizing but also functional across a wide range in sizes,

ments regenerate to form a perfectly shaped worm within 2 weeks (green lines mark
the cuts, white tissue parts indicate the regeneration site before all pigments have been

see Fig. 1.7. For example, regeneration comprises a tightly controlled sequence of
responses (4, 10, 13, 14, 69, 81, 117, 128, 158, 165, 170, 237). After an immediate muscle
contraction to close the wound, a peak in cell division together with the migration of
stem cells within the rst 12 h generates an outgrowth of undierentiated tissue at the
wound site, the blastema. In a second step, the now oversized, remaining body parts
are re-patterned to match the size of the amputation fragment. The corresponding
process is called morphollaxis and comprises a more sustained proliferation and cell
death response during the following days. All this pattern formation is guided by
an internal coordinate system that is re-established as one of the earliest cues in the
remaining worm fragment independently of cell dierentiation (81, 141).
Our work is especially focussed on the anterior-posterior (AP) axis specifying head
and tail position. The Wnt/ -catenin system is a conserved pathway for such AP
patterning in many animals and it is also key for the AP polarity in atworms (4, 9,
54, 81, 82, 141, 160). There are 9 Wnt genes in atworms. In particular the canonical
Wnts (activating -catenin signaling) are highly expressed in the tail. Inhibition of
the Wnt/-catenin system leads to formation of additional heads, while overexpression
induces tail identity everywhere in the worm (3, 82, 82, 160). Remarkably, reducing
the level of -catenin is sucient to induce full regenerative power to some atworm
species that are usually decient in head regeneration (116, 200, 222). Taken together,
the experiments suggest that -catenin is instructive for positional information along
the AP axis in a concentration-dependent manner.
121.3 Theories of body plan patterning by morphogens
Perpendicular to the AP axis, the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis and the medial-lateral (ML)
axis are formed (54, 117). For example, the DV axis is specied by the interplay between
the TGF-family members Bmp and Admp. Together, all three body axes are charac-
terized by gradients in abundance and expression of specic molecules, in neoblast
mitotic activity as well as in membrane potential (4, 9, 23, 62, 81, 149, 201) and it is
a major open question how these gradients robustly guide body plan patterning irre-
spective of the size of the organism.
1.3. Theories of body plan patterning by morphogens
Here, we will discuss two ideas of pattern formation based on cell-cell communication
via morphogens. The rst type of mechanisms describes how a pre-existing structure
can act as an organizing center for the development of further patterns. Such theories
are built on the idea of a well-dened, sequential developmental program where existing
patterns determine the formation of new patterns, see Fig. 1.8(a). Maternal patterning
cues provide a pre-pattern for the embryonic tissues forming from an egg cell and the
layout in the embryo determines the future body plan of the animal (2, 57, 172). For
example the localization of bicoid mRNA to the anterior pole of the y embryo is a
maternal eect. However, the impressive capabilities of atworms to regenerate from
almost arbitrary initial fragments challenge these concepts, see Fig. 1.8(b). In contrast
to the sequential patterning from predened cues, Alan Turing introduced a second
class of mechanisms for self-organized pattern formation (221). We will discuss both
approaches and assess them from a biological perspective.
Body plan patterning requires that cell fates are assigned depending on the relative
position of the cells in the tissue or the organism (68, 244). In order to obtain the
information about their spatial position, cells sense their environment and communicate
with each other. For that, cells respond to mechanical cues as well as chemical signals
such as morphogens (89, 112, 147, 174, 224).
Signaling molecules often establish long-range, graded concentration proles, which can
be accounted for by the interplay of transport and degradation (76, 223, 232). Cells
respond to the concentration of these molecules in their local environment. Thus, a
graded morphogen concentration can provide cells with the information about its spatial
distance from the morphogen source (243), see Fig. 1.9(a). This idea forms the basis for
the French ag model, which draws a simplied picture of how body plan patterning
might be guided by graded morphogen proles. For example, a stripe pattern can be

generated if cellular dierentiation depends on discrete, genetically encoded threshold
levels. In Fig. 1.9(a), cells turn blue if the morphogen concentration is above the rst
threshold level and red if it is below the second threshold level. Several intersecting
gradients can generate more complex patterns.
Dose-dependent responses have indeed been observed in experiments, yet in a more
complex way than given by the simplied French ag model (72, 74, 75, 80, 104, 191,
242). For example, cells of the frog Xenopus show a distinct dierentiation response to
at least ve concentration thresholds of Activin (72, 75). However, the early response
of the individual cells is less specic and very inhomogeneous (73, 242). It appears
that only the interaction between cells leads to the well-dened behavior of the cell
aggregate. Furthermore, the cells in the tissue are reported to respond in a ratchet-like
manner to the highest level of Activin to which they were exposed (80). Similar dose-
dependent responses have also been recently reported for Wnts in the frog embryo with
respect to the AP axis patterning (104).
Thus, although the simple concept of a direct threshold-comparison has been questioned
in some organisms, the French ag model continues to provide a pictorial representa-
tion of the case where a feedback on the concentration gradient by the responding cells
can be neglected. As an extension, it also has been proposed that the cells might com-
pare spatial and temporal dierences in morphogen concentration and correspondingly
adjust cell division, dierentiation and motility (135, 167, 175, 233, 234, 235).
The described mechanisms can explain patterning, given a pre-dened source region
where morphogens are produced locally. Yet, how is this source region established
in the rst place? One possibility is that another graded morphogen prole specied

Figure 1.9.: (a) The French ag model substantiates the idea that a graded mor-

adopt distinct cell fates (sketched blue, white, red) by responding to the local mor-
phogen concentration depending on whether a certain threshold is met. The model
assumes a pre-dened source region (grey), which secretes the morphogens. (b) In

interact. Source regions (gray) of the morphogens are established in a self-organized
way (here: a source forms where the concentration of the rst morphogen is larger
than the concentration of the second morphogen).
this source by a threshold rule and a sequential developmental program establishes one
pattern from an already existing one, see Fig. 1.8(a). An alternative explanation dates
back to Alan Turing. In a seminal paper from 1952, he proposed a general framework
for the spontaneous formation of biological patterns, independent of pre-patterning
cues (221). Turing's framework was later further explored by Meinhardt and Gierer
(64, 65, 66, 106, 120).
Turing demonstrated how the interaction of at least two diusing molecular species
can result in chemical patterns in a completely self-organized manner, see Fig. 1.9(b).
Thereby, these (often periodic) patterns specify their own production regions. It is an
appealing idea that the chemical patterns layout the body plan of an animal. Yet for
the following 50 years, there was only little experimental evidence for Turing's ideas
and the focus of developmental biology was shifted to other patterning mechanisms
like the French ag model (74). Certainly this was partly due to the fact that it is
generally dicult to demonstrate experimentally that a specic pattern is generated by
a Turing mechanism. While a unidirectional relationship like in the French ag model
(where a concentration of one molecule has a particular eect on other molecules or the
cells) is straight forward to analyze, this is less so for Turing patterning which includes
cross-reaction terms. The behaviour of a Turing system is often counterintuitive and its
analysis might easily yield misleading results. For example, the concentration of some
151. INTRODUCTION
Turing molecules peak at the maximum concentration of their repressors, compare to
Section 1.4. Furthermore, if there are more than two chemical species involved, the con-
centration of one of them might decrease upon knockout of its direct activator because
of additional indirect eects, see Appendix A.7.4 for an example. Despite the chal-
lenging task of revealing the existence of Turing patterns and identifying the involved
molecules, recently more and more evidence has been accumulated that Turing's ideas
might be the guiding principles for the formation of a wide range of biological patterns,
ranging from the formation of digits in vertebrate limbs to the emergence of left-right
asymmetry (49, 119, 134, 137, 164, 191, 197). Some of these examples combine Turing
patterning with a French ag model.
In fact, in many biological systems, pattern formation might result from a combination
of both concepts (74). The feedback loop of a Turing mechanism ensures high robust-
ness and possesses the ability to generate chemical patterns from random uctuations.
In particular, Turing systems can spontaneously generate graded concentration proles
like required for the French ag model. In turn, biological patterns hardly emerge in
a completely homogeneous environment without any pre-patterning cues, as Turing al-
ready remarked (221). During development as well as during regeneration, pre-existing
morphogen proles and tissue structures can guide the formation of chemical patterns.
Thus, Turing mechanisms might often be found downstream of morphogen proles that
modify the respective patterns (74, 164).
1.4. Turing mechanism yields self-organized patterns
In 1952, Alan Turing introduced a generic framework for the self-organized formation
of chemical patterns in biology (221). He asked the very general question whether there
are conditions, under which a system of two or more diusing and reacting chemical
species possesses a homogeneous steady state, which is linearly unstable with respect to
inhomogeneous perturbations, such that inhomogeneous patterns form spontaneously.
Very importantly, in consequence, any model for self-organized patterning based on
diusing and cross-reacting molecules can be understood within the Turing framework
(64, 65, 120, 147, 195, 221). Recently, there are attempts to further generalize the
Turing mechanism to generic interactions between two players without a diusion term
(136, 236).
In the following we show that the conditions for a Turing instability can be derived
from the linear stability analysis of the homogeneous steady state. For this, we briey
161.4 Turing mechanism yields self-organized patterns
recall the basic Turing model comprising two chemical species with concentrations A
andB. Details on the derivations are provided in Appendix A.3 or in the literature
(64, 65, 146, 195, 221). The general reaction-diusion system for two molecular species
in one space dimension is
@tA=RA(A;B) +DA@2
xA
@tB=RB(A;B) +DB@2
xB; (1.1)
with diusion coecients DAandDBand two generic functions RAandRBdescribing
the reactions between the dierent molecules and the eects of each molecular species
on itself. In order to spontaneously form stable patterns from random uctuations,
these reaction functions have to fulll two requirements: the homogenous steady state
(A
h;B
h), dened by RA(A
h;B
h) = 0 andRB(A
h;B
h) = 0, has to be (i) stable with
respect to homogeneous perturbations (to avoid a diverging behavior), yet (ii) unstable
with respect to inhomogeneous perturbations.
It is possible to derive a set of necessary conditions for spontaneous pattern formation
from these two conditions above by applying linear stability analysis. For this, we
consider a small perturbation ( a;b) about the homogeneous steady state: A=A
h+a
andB=B
h+b. The linearized form of Eq. 1.1 can be written as
@t

Here, the perturbation modes as(t) andbs(t) with wavenumber srepresent the spatial
Fourier transform of a(t;x) andb(t;x), respectively:
as(t) =Z
a(x;t)e 2sx=Ldx; bs(t) =Z

Figure 1.10.: There are two possible feedback topologies that lead to pattern for-
mation in a Turing system with two molecular species ( AandB): (a) an activator-
inhibitor scheme with activator Aand inhibitor B, (b) a second topology where both
chemical species have activating and inhibiting eects. We show two examples of
typical concentration proles corresponding to the two feedback topologies. The self-
organized source regions are indicated in gray.
In consequence, we obtain several constraints on the reaction design, which have been
summarized by the principle of local activation and lateral inhibition (64, 65, 120, 146,
147), see Appendix A.3 for details and Fig. 1.10 for illustration of the allowed feedback
topologies. The necessary conditions for spontaneous pattern formation are:
1. One molecule has to be self-activating and the other self-inhibiting. In the following,
we chooseAto be the self-activator and Bthe self-inhibitor:
@ARA>0 and@BRB<0: (1.6)
2. There have to be cross-reaction terms of opposing sign:


3. The diusion coecient of the self-activator has to be suciently smaller than the
diusion coecient of the self-inhibitor:
DA<DB: (1.8)
As a result for a Turing system with two chemical species, there are two possible network
topologies as depicted in Fig. 1.10. In Turing feedback 1, the concentration Ahas only

activating eects and Bhas only inhibiting eects both on itself and the respective
other player. In this case, we can shortly refer to AandBas the concentrations of
activator and inhibitor instead of self-activator and self-inhibitor. In Turing feedback 2,
both molecular species have activating and inhibiting eects. This includes depletion
models, where, for example, binding of both molecular species enhances the production
ofAbut consumes B(66). Note that there is a formal correspondence between the two
Turing topologies by the replacement B!Bc Bwith a constant parameter Bc.
How the principle of local activation and lateral inhibition leads to spontaneous pat-
tern formation can be nicely demonstrated for the Turing feedback 1 of Fig. 1.10(a).
At the source, the activator dominates because the inhibitor is diusing away more
quickly. Consequently, the source region stabilizes itself and initially tends to expand.
In contrast, some distance away from the source, the inhibitor dominates due to its fast
diusion. This creates at least two distinct regions, which already comprises a simple
pattern. In contrast to other systems where diusion homogenizes a pattern, here dif-
fusive spreading in combination with specic reactions enhances small inhomogeneities
in the concentrations. Therefore, it is sometimes also referred to as a diusion-driven
instability (145, 146, 181).
1.5. Open questions in the study of growth control and
scalable body patterning
During development, growth and regeneration, cells communicate with each other and
mutually inuence their behavior, especially by changing the expression status of their
genes. This information exchange orchestrates cell division, cell death and dieren-
tiation. It can also guide cell migration and can elicit the release of further signals,
e.g. the secretion of morphogens. As a common theme of this thesis, we devise theo-
retical descriptions of how cell fate decisions based on local rules on the microscopic
scale result in the formation and maintenance of a macroscopic body plan, drawing
inspiration from atworms as a specic model organism. In particular, we address the
following questions:
How is the turnover of cells regulated during growth and homeostasis and
how are uxes in cell number related to uxes of metabolic energy? Organisms
have to control the number of cells to ensure homeostasis and growth in a well-dened
manner. As changes in cell number depend on the balance between cell proliferation
and cell loss, there needs to be a communication between dividing and dierentiated
191. INTRODUCTION
cells (158). Furthermore, the environment and in particular the availability of food
provides an external stimulus to inuence cell behavior, such as proliferation and cell
death (113, 244).
What are minimal requirements for self-organized patterns that scale with
organism size? Organisms also have to control the type and position of cells for a
reliable body plan patterning. Again, this requires a communication between cells,
ranging from direct neighbor-neighbor interactions to long range signaling via mobile
molecules such as morphogens (54, 68, 244). Importantly, pattern formation can be
observed on all length scales from the development of a fertilized egg to growth and
regeneration of large scale tissues in mature organisms. Yet, patterning mechanisms of-
ten possess xed characteristic length scales dened by the intrinsic physical properties
of the system (76, 223, 232), which is challenged by cases of biological pattern scaling
like regeneration in atworms.
We aim to understand scalable body plan patterning and cell turnover dynamics by
building on the framework of dynamical systems theory and birth-death processes.
Biological systems add a new perspective to those classical concepts. They usually
operate far from equilibrium and form patterns with unconventional properties (39,
87, 120). Development and regeneration are subject to a high level of noise ranging
from external perturbation like a variable environment to the intrinsically stochastic
nature of gene expression (77, 218, 219). Thus, robust growth control and body plan
patterning require reliable sensing, transmitting and processing of noisy information
(47, 218). We address the question of robustness with respect to initial conditions and
physical parameters as well as the structural robustness of the models.
This thesis is mainly inspired by the astonishing scaling and regeneration capabilities
of atworms, yet the results obtained here are likely also to be relevant for other bio-
logical organisms as well as related questions in biological physics, nonlinear dynamics
and pattern formation.
201.6 Organization of the thesis
1.6. Organization of the thesis
In this thesis, we investigate biological shape and size control on various levels, for which
we combine theoretical descriptions and state-of-the-art analyses of experimental data
in atworms.
First, we explore mechanisms for self-organized and self-scaling pattern formation
(Chapter 2). We discuss to what extent previously proposed theories can account
for the scaling of morphogen proles. For this, we adhere to a strict mathematical
denition of scaling and illustrate the dierence between perfect scaling and approxi-
mate scaling with system size. Furthermore, we demonstrate the absence of scaling in
classical Turing pattering, going beyond linear stability analysis.
Second, atworms like Smed challenge existing theories on body plan patterning, which
typically can at most only explain one of both: either scaling or self-organization. Here,
we introduce and characterize a novel class of mechanisms that combine both features
(Chapter 3). The developed theory can act as a framework to understand robust body
plan scaling during growth and regeneration in atworms.
Next, worm shape variations cannot only be observed between dierent stages of de-
velopment, growth and regeneration. Individual worms also show large body deforma-
tion during movement, driven by muscle contractions. We apply a method based on
\Principal component analysis" to characterize shape dynamics and analyze movement
patterns. A similar shape mode analysis also enables us to compare shapes of dierent
related species. Analyzing motility patterns and comparing shape variations between
worm species is the rst step towards relating form and function (Chapter 4).
Finally, we analyze growth and degrowth dynamics and their dependence on feeding
conditions. We investigate mechanisms for size control by metabolic energy balances
to explain the macroscopic growth and degrowth behavior in terms of microscopic cell
turnover dynamics. Our theory makes testable predictions for the ongoing experiments.
Beyond, we develop the theoretical basis for additional measurements on various scales
to reveal further details about the control logic of cell turnover (Chapter 5).
212. Scaling in morphogen systems
2.1. Scaling of biological patterns
The development of multi-cellular organisms with a well-dened, complex body plan is
one of the most fascinating processes in nature. A series of patterning events take place
“The continuous change in form that takes place
from hour to hour puzzles us by its very simpli-
city. The geometric patterns that present them-
selves at every turn invite mathematical analy-
sis.” — Experimental embryology, Thomas H.
Morgan, 1927 (130)across various length scales leading to a distinct
layout, which is scaled to match the size of the
organism. The scaling of body plan patterns be-
comes especially apparent if a juvenile organism
already resembles its adult counterpart or if indi-
viduals of dierent, yet related species look very
much alike besides their great dierences in size (27, 76, 223). A third, more subtle
example is the robust formation of proportionate patterns in the same organism during
development despite size variations that arise from varying environmental conditions
or stochastic uctuations of growth rates (24, 76).
In this chapter, we analyze to what extent previously proposed theories can account
for pattern scaling. First, we introduce a mathematical denition of gradient scaling.
Based on these considerations, we revisit and assess scaling mechanisms proposed for
morphogen gradients in pre-patterned systems and extract the main principles under-
lying scaling. This will later allow us to point out the important dierences between
scaling mechanisms for pre-patterned and self-organized systems in Chapter 3. Fur-
thermore, we discuss the absence of scaling in self-organized Turing systems beyond
the classical approach of linear stability analysis. The latter has been published in
Werner et al. (239).
222.2 Morphogen dynamics and concentration proles
2.2. Morphogen dynamics and concentration proles
One of the most simple morphogen systems that result in graded concentration proles
draws on diusion from a localized source with an eective diusion coecient Dand
a linear degradation with rate (232). It has been frequently applied to describe mor-
phogen gradients in the fruit y (24, 44, 76, 78, 234). Note that eective diusion might
result from a wide range of underlying undirected processes, such as active transport
or even signaling between neighboring cells without secretion of motile molecules.
For simplicity, we consider a one-dimensional system of size Lwith reecting boundary
conditions. The corresponding time evolution of the morphogen concentration C=
C(t;x) is given by
@tC=D@2
xC C+ (2.1)
@xCjx=0=@xCjx=L= 0: (2.2)
Here,(x) =(w x) describes localized morphogen production with rate in a
source of width w.  denotes the Heaviside step function.
Eq. 2.1 also holds in two and three dimensions, if the system is symmetric with respect
to the other dimensions and, thus, the morphogen concentration still only depends on
x, see Appendix A.1.1. If the tissue grows at a time scale comparable to the time scale
of the morphogen dynamics, one has to consider additional terms for advection and
dilution.
The steady state solution to Eq. 2.1-2.2 is computed in Appendix A.1.2. Here, we are
mainly concerned with the steady state concentration outside the source region, which
is given by
C(x) =C0cosh(L= x=)
cosh(L=)forwxL (2.3)
with amplitude
C0=sinh(w=)
tanh(L=)(2.4)
and a characteristic length scale
=p
D=: (2.5)
Within the course of a characteristic time scale (which is of the order of 1 =in our
example, see Appendix A.1.3), the morphogen will relax towards this steady state pro-
le. Analyzing the steady state is well justied in a case of separated time scales,
where other dynamics (e.g. growth and dierentiation) are slow in comparison to the
relaxation time of the morphogen prole. In the following, we will often assume such
232. SCALING IN MORPHOGEN SYSTEMS
a quasi steady state. One should keep in mind that this is a simplifying assumption
which is not always fullled. In fact, it has been argued that many gradients might be
already read out before the steady state is reached as a means to increase robustness
(20, 29, 55, 167). Yet, even in these cases, the steady state is the reference state and
provides a rst order approximation to the concentration the cells actually respond to.
2.3. Scaling of concentration proles with system size
Proles of signaling molecules have been measured for example in the fruit y Droso-
phila melanogaster , which is an important model organism to study biological pattern
formation (123, 206). Quantications of morphogen concentrations in the developing
wing and eye of the y at dierent stages of development revealed that the concentration
proles maintain an approximately constant shape relative to the changing size of the
growing tissue (26, 83, 234, 235). This biological observation of proles that scale with
system size inspired the development of a number of theoretical mechanisms that can
account for pattern scaling (11, 24, 26, 27, 96, 135, 148, 154, 223, 233, 234). In this
section, we discuss examples, which represent two major classes of these mechanisms.
We dene a mathematical property of perfect shape scaling and analyze approximations
of this property.
We dene perfect shape scaling as the ideal case of strictly proportional scaling of a
concentration prole with system size. In this case, the concentration at steady state
can be written as
C(x;L) =C0(L)Z(x=L); (2.6)
whereC0(L) denotes a possibly size-dependent amplitude and Z(x=L) denes the shape
of the prole, which only depends on the relative spatial coordinate x=L. As a result,
scaling proles from systems of dierent sizes perfectly collapse onto a single master
curve if plotted as a function of relative coordinates and normalized by their amplitude,
see Fig. 2.1(a). For the steady state solution in Eq. 2.3, perfect shape scaling arises
if the characteristic gradient range is not constant but strictly proportional to the
length of the system L:
/L: (2.7)
In a more general case, if the length scale increases with Lin a monotonic, yet
nonlinear fashion, we will classify this as approximate scaling , see Fig. 2.1(b):
@L>0: (2.8)

Figure 2.1.: Illustration of the mathematical concept of perfect shape scaling and
approximate scaling : (a) Perfect shape scaling: normalized concentration proles col-
lapse onto a master curve when plotted as a function of the relative position. (b) In
a more general case, concentration proles might expand with system size, though
the collapse onto a single master curve is only approximate. We classify this case as
approximate scaling.
In the following, we will strictly distinguish between the two notions of approximate
scaling and perfect shape scaling . This slightly academic distinction will prove use-
ful in the subsequent mathematical analysis. Nonetheless, we want to emphasize that
approximate scaling can be virtually indistinguishable from the ideal case of perfect
shape scaling, both in measurements and simulations. In contrast to our theoretical
description, real systems are generally prone to intrinsic uctuations and measurement
inaccuracies. Furthermore, the separation of time scales between system growth and
morphogen dynamics assumed here will always be an approximation, such that the mor-
phogen concentration never exactly corresponds to the theoretically computed steady
state prole. Therefore, even if the underlying mechanism is in principle able to gener-
ate proles that perfectly scale like in Fig. 2.1, we will never observe a perfect collapse of
the measured concentration proles. On the contrary, mechanisms of approximate scal-
ing that cannot yield perfect shape scaling in the sense of Eq. 2.6, may still fully account

Figure 2.2.: Size-dependent amplitudes of scaling proles: Models for the scaling of
morphogen proles often assume the adjustment of degradation rate or diusion
coecientDwith system size L. As a result, the amplitude of the morphogen concen-
tration might change depending on whether the morphogen source size (gray) is xed
(upper row) or scales with L(lower row). The reference prole (red) is the same in all
plots (Eq. 2.3, == 10,L== 2,L=w = 5). The other proles correspond to either
half (blue) or twice the system size (green) with constant ratio L=and either scaling
or non-scaling source size w.
for gradient scaling as observed in biological systems. As an example for a mechanism
that yields approximate scaling, we discuss a simple realization of a prominent scaling
mechanism, the expansion-repression model. We emphasize that this mechanism has
been successfully applied to analyse prole scaling in y wing development (24, 26, 27).
According to the denition of in Eq, 2.5, scaling can be achieved if either the diusion
coecient or the degradation rate or both depend on system size. Two simple choices
are: (i)D/L2,= const and (ii) /L 2,D= const.
In Eq. 2.6, we dened scaling of morphogen proles as a shape property, irrespective of
the amplitude C0(L). This amplitude might be a function of system size L, compare
also to (223). The variation of the amplitude with Lcan reveal details of the underlying
scaling mechanism, see Fig. 2.2. We discuss this for the two limiting cases of (i) a source
of xed width wand (ii) a scaling source w/L.
(i) Fixed source: If we increase by enhancing diusion, the amplitude will decrease
because the same amount of morphogen is distributed more homogeneously in the
system, compare to Eq. 2.4 or Eq. A.5. In contrast, if we increase by reducing
degradation, the amplitude will increase due to a longer lifetime of the molecules. If D
262.4 Scaling of morphogen proles in pre-patterned systems
andboth depend on size, the amplitude can be kept constant.
(ii) Scaling source: Eq. 2.4 shows that for this case the amplitude does not explicitely
depend onDbut depends inversely on . Scaling by changing the diusion properties
does not aect the amplitude but scaling by adjustment of degradation leads to a strong
size dependence C0/L2.
Measurements of the signaling protein Dpp in the fruit y found a decreasing degra-
dation rate with size as well as the characteristic increase in the amplitude (76, 78,
135, 233, 234). In the clawed frog, both cases have been reported, adjustment of diu-
sion properties for Bmp as well as adjustment of degradation for the Bmp antagonist
Chordin (25, 94).
Next, we discuss two classes of simple models for the scaling of morphogen proles,
which represent minimal versions of scaling mechanisms proposed in the literature
(11, 24, 26, 27, 96, 135, 148, 154, 223, 233, 234). We will illustrate that models of
the second class rely on a changing amplitude during scaling. Thus, the amplitude of
the morphogen prole encodes the system size.
2.4. Scaling of morphogen proles in pre-patterned systems
2.4.1. The concept of an expander as a chemical size reporter
In order to achieve scaling of a morphogen prole in a simple set-up as introduced in
Section 2.2, the length scale of the concentration prole has to couple to the size of
the system. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the expansion of a morphogen
prole with system size Lthat assume an additional molecular species, often called
\expander" (11, 24, 27, 96, 135, 148, 154, 233, 234). If the concentration Eof such
an expander is a function of L, the interaction of these expander molecules with the
morphogen can result in prole expansion with system size. Depending on whether the
expander concentration increases or decreases with system size, the expander might
enhance or reduce either diusion or degradation of the morphogen, respectively.
Yet, how does the expander obtain its size-dependent concentration and become a
chemical size reporter? In the following, we discuss two main classes of expander me-
chanisms that have been proposed for the scaling of morphogen proles. The rst class
is characterized by the fact that the expander couples to the system size independently
of the morphogen. The second class subsumes mechanisms that allow for self-scaling of
the morphogen prole by a feedback loop between the expander and the morphogen.
272. SCALING IN MORPHOGEN SYSTEMS
We illustrate the scope and the limits of the mechanisms at hand. This allows us to
systematically extract the main principles that lead to robust scaling as applied later
to self-organized systems.
2.4.2. A simple mechanism of gradient scaling:
The expander-dilution model
The most simple idea for how an expander concentration can report on system size is
given by the expander-dilution mechanism (135, 233, 234), see Fig. 2.3(a). It requires a
constant amount of a long-lived expander, which is neither produced nor degraded. As
the system size increases, the expander gets diluted and, thus, the expander concentra-
tion depends on system size. Hence, E/1=Lin a one-dimensional system. However,
such a mechanism is highly vulnerable to the loss of expander and in particular could
not easily cope with amputations of parts of the system.
A similar mechanism can overcome this issue by reading out system size from geo-
metrical features like area-volume ratios. As a specic example, we assume that the
expander of concentration Eis degraded everywhere in the one-dimensional system and
produced in a source of constant width wEat the boundary:
@tE(t;x) =DE@2
xE(t;x) EE(t;x) +E(wE L+x); (2.9)
Again,DEis an eective diusion coecient, Ethe degradation rate and Ethe pro-
duction rate of the expander. In the limit of fast expander diusion ( E=p
DE=E
L), the steady state concentration is given by
E=EwE
E1
L: (2.10)
Thus, the expander level Eencodes the system size L, see Fig. 2.3(b). In order for the
morphogen to scale with L, the morphogen degradation could for example be coupled
to the expander as
/E2: (2.11)
The size read-out can also be established dierently from the specic choice of Eq. 2.9,
see Appendix A.2.1 for a general derivation. For example, the expander could be
produced everywhere in the system and only be degraded at the boundary, as discussed
by other authors (78, 90, 96, 148, 154).
The mechanism is robust against loss of expander, but it requires ELirrespective
of system size. Note that a small degradation rate results in a large E, yet also in a
slow relaxation to the steady state, see Appendix A.1.3. Furthermore, the mechanism

relies on a tightly controlled size of the source and the degradation zone. In the example
above, the expander source has to keep its width although the system size changes. This
shifts the problem from scaling the morphogen prole to establishing a source pattern
for the expander. Finally, regeneration of arbitrarily shaped fragments seems unlikely
to agree with the notion of a xed geometry of source and degradation zone. Therefore,
we next discuss the second class of scaling mechanisms, in which the morphogen itself
controls the expander expression leading to a self-regulating feedback loop.
2.4.3. Perfect shape scaling vs. approximate scaling:
The expansion-repression model
The discussion on morphogen scaling has been enriched by the proposal of a class
of models that adjust gradient shape to system size in a self-organized manner (24,
26). These mechanisms build on a feedback loop between morphogen and expander.
Interestingly, this relates to the engineering framework of an integral feedback control,
where the gradient is adjusted by the expander as long as it does not meet its target
range (19, 24). One prominent example is the expansion-repression model. In order to
illustrate the main principles, we discuss one specic simple realization of this model, in
which the expander production is only turned on where the morphogen level falls below
a threshold Cthlike considered in (135), see Fig. 2.4(a). Alternative feedback topologies
are analyzed in Appendix A.2.3 and lead qualitatively to the same conclusions.

In order to close the feedback loop and adjust the morphogen length scales, the expander
has to aect either diusion or degradation of the morphogen, see Section 2.3.
A simple feedback scheme that yields approximate scaling, though not perfect shape scal-
ing. | Let us start with a simple realization of the expansion-repression mechanism,
which has been rst proposed for gradient scaling in the developing y wing (24). In
this realization, it is considered that the expander suppresses the degradation of the
morphogen (24, 26, 135). Thus, in Eq. 2.1 is not constant anymore but obeys
=0
1 +E=Eth(2.13)
with two constant parameters 0andEth. In consequence, increasing expander levels
enlarge the range of the morphogen. Yet, in turn, this suppresses the expander pro-
duction. Eventually, a steady state is reached, in which the expander production is
just cancelled by the total expander degradation in the system. The source size of the
expander in this steady state is determined by
C(L w
E) =Cth; (2.14)
whereCis given by Eq. 2.3 and w
Edenotes the size of the self-organized source region
of the expander, see Fig. 2.4(a). In the limit of a quickly spreading expander ( EL),
its steady state concentration is
E=Ew
E
EL: (2.15)
From this, we can note the following observations: First, the expander source (estab-
lished by the feedback with the morphogen) must not scale ( w
E6/L), because this
would result in a constant expander level irrespective of system size. Second, the mor-
phogen amplitude must change for perfect scaling. Otherwise, if the amplitude were
constant with a scaling gradient range /L, we would obtain w
E/Lfrom Eq. 2.14
and the expander would not encode the system size. This generally arises from the
fact that in such a mechanism for scaling via a feedback loop both players, morphogen
and expander, have to encode the system size in the steady state. Third, the particu-
lar feedback scheme including Eq. 2.13 yields approximate scaling of the concentration
proles, though not a perfectly linear relationship of /Las required for perfect shape
scaling, see Fig. 2.4(b)-(c).

The gradient range increases with system size in a sub-linear fashion. We deter-
mineby (i) computing =p
D= at various positions in the system (blue dots),
(ii) tting the solution of Eq. 2.3 (solid red line) and (iii) calculating it directly in
the limit of EL(dashed green line). We use typical parameters for the y
wing:D= 1m2/s,DE= 10m2/s,= 0:01M/s,E= 0:001M/s,w=L = 0:1,
Cth= 0:1M,E= 10 4/s,0= 10 2/s,Eth= 1M,L= 25:::135m (24, 26).
This choice of parameters allows us to illustrate deviations from perfect shape scal-
ing. Other parameter sets might approximate scaling better and might be practically
indistinguishable from the mathematical limit of perfect shape scaling.
The latter can be understood most clearly if we ask what relationship between and
Ewould be needed for the steady-state morphogen range =Lto scale with a
constant factor . In Appendix A.2.2, we provide a detailed derivation for dierent
scenarios. Here, we only discuss the case of a scaling morphogen source ( w/L) as a
representative example. If we combine Eq. 2.3, 2.14 and 2.15, we obtain
=L)/coshE
EE
(2.16)
Thus, this functional relationship between andE, which would be required to achieve
perfect shape scaling, is dierent from the relationship, we had originally assumed
in Eq. 2.13. Note the qualitative dierence between the two relationships: whereas
Eq. 2.16 corresponds to a positive feedback loop, Eq. 2.13 describes a negative feed-
back loop. We conclude that the considered case of Eq. 2.12 and Eq. 2.13 does not
yield perfect shape scaling, though approximate scaling is nonetheless possible. Such
approximate scaling can be practically indistinguishable from perfect shape scaling as
has been demonstrated by numerical simulations of the discussed feedback and related
versions (24, 26, 135).
312. SCALING IN MORPHOGEN SYSTEMS
2.4.4. Other feedback schemes for self-organized gradient scaling
The classical expansion-repression mechanism relies on a feedback in which the mor-
phogen suppresses the expander while the expander increases the range of the mor-
phogen. In consequence, this forms an overall negative feedback loop. In Sec. 2.4.3
we discussed an example which does robustly lead to approximate scaling, though not
perfect shape scaling. Would perfect shape scaling be possible if we deviate from the
scheme of a negative feedback loop?
Eq. 2.16 provides the functional relationship between andEthat would be required
for perfect shape scaling in the steady state. Thus, we could replace Eq. 2.13 by
/cosh (E=Eth): (2.17)
Then, the system possesses a steady state pattern that scales perfectly by construction.
However, this steady state is unstable in numerical simulations as it forms an overall
positive feedback loop. An excess in expander would reduce the level of morphogen by
enhanced degradation and thus the expander production and consequently the expander
level would increase even further. Depending on the initial conditions, the system
shows two distinct dynamics. For small expander levels below the unstable steady
state, the expander source will eventually be suppressed completely and the morphogen
concentration will diverge. For large expander levels, the system will converge to a
second, non-scaling steady state.
Variations of the expander feedback show qualitatively similar results. | In Ap-
pendix A.2.2-A.2.3, we discuss further variations of the feedback scheme of Eqs. 2.12-
2.13. For these variations, we likewise nd approximate scaling, though no perfect shape
scaling in a strict mathematical sense over a large size range. As a general rule, the
ideal case of perfect shape scaling and stability are not easily teamed up. We strongly
emphasize that this does not imply that the mechanisms for approximate scaling can-
not provide suitable theoretical descriptions for gradient scaling in biological systems.
Furthermore, more complex feedback schemes might be able to achieve perfect shape
scaling or at least closely mimic perfect scaling over a considerable size range (24).
2.4.5. Conclusions from our analysis of expander models
Above, we discussed simple realizations of scaling mechanisms for morphogen proles,
representing two main classes of such mechanisms, see Fig. 2.5. If the expander mea-
sures system size independently of the morphogen, this can result in a robust size

Figure 2.5.: Various mechanisms have been proposed for the scaling of morphogen
proles using an expander as a chemical size-reporter: (a) the rst class of models
considers an expander which reads out system size independently of the morphogen,
see (78, 90, 96, 135, 148, 154, 233, 234) for examples, (b) the second class of models
assumes a feedback loop between the morphogen and the expander such that the mor-
phogen prole scales itself (24, 26). We demonstrated that in this case it is challenging
to obtain a perfectly scaling steady state. The table summarizes the results for a mor-
phogen that acts on the expander production like in Eq. 2.12, see Appendix A.2.2-A.2.3
for details. For all cases, it is possible to construct a robust feedback yielding good
approximations to the idealized case perfect shape scaling.
read-out and potentially lead to scaling (78, 90, 96, 135, 148, 154, 233, 234). Yet, it re-
quires a tightly controlled layout of the system, e.g. pre-patterned sources and sinks for
the expander. Thus, it does not easily comply with the ability to regenerate and might
just shift the problem from the scaling of the morphogen gradient to the establishment
of a source and sink pattern for the expander.
The second class of models aims to establish scaling of the morphogen prole in a self-
organized manner by a feedback loop between the morphogen and the expander (24, 26).
It turns out that it is challenging to nd mechanisms with steady state patterns that
are both: perfectly scaling in the sense of Eq. 2.6 and stable. If a feedback is chosen,
such that a perfectly scaling steady state exists like in Eq. 2.17, this xed point might
not to be stable. Still, many models like the one dened by Eqs. 2.12-2.13 yield stable
steady states, which can well approximate perfect scaling, depending on the choice of
parameters (24, 26).
332. SCALING IN MORPHOGEN SYSTEMS
The intuitive picture is that an overall negative feedback loop between morphogen and
expander ensures a stable steady state. In contrast, two mutually suppressing molecular
species, which might yield perfect shape scaling, form an overall positive feedback loop.
Thus, they will not result in a stable steady state unless there are additional feedback
loops. In Chapter 3, we discuss a novel self-organizing scaling mechanism that builds
on such feedback regulations.
An important signature of the second class of models is that the morphogen amplitude
varies with size L. This is a direct consequence of the feedback with a quickly spreading
expander, which ensures a uniform expansion of the gradient range across the system. It
can be understood intuitively because the morphogen not only couples to the expander
but also the expander couples to the morphogen, hence, both have to encode the system
size. This can result in constraints on the system design. For example, it led to the
observation that the combination of a scaling morphogen source and an adjustment of
morphogen diusion by the expander could not yield scaling of the morphogen prole.
We will have to take this into account when discussing scaling in self-organized systems
in Chapter 3.
2.5. Revisiting the absence of scaling in Turing patterns
In this thesis, we consider one specic choice of a Turing system, which is particularly
suitable for analytical treatment. We restrict our analysis to a one-dimensional system
with reecting boundary conditions. The dynamics of the two molecules are described
by
@tA=AP(A;B) AA+DA@2
xA
@tB=BP(A;B) BB+DB@2
xB: (2.18)
Thus, we specically consider linear degradation with rates A,Band production
with rates A,B. The function P(A;B) implements a switch-like response to the
concentrations AandB. Production is switched on if the activator concentration
exceeds the inhibitor concentration, AB. We choose a Hill function, which arises
naturally from cooperative and competitive chemical reactions in biological systems,
see Appendix A.4:
P(A;B) =Ah
Ah+Bh: (2.19)
In the limit h!1 , the Hill function can be replaced by the Heaviside theta function
P(A;B) = (A B): (2.20)
342.5 Revisiting the absence of scaling in Turing patterns
As a technical point, we have to dene (0)!= 0, in order for the homogeneous steady
state to always exist, see Appendix A.5. A Fermi function could be another choice to
account for switch-like production, yielding similar results.
In the case of the production switch in Eq. 2.20, the relative source size is dened by
`=L=hPi=1
LZL
0Pdx; (2.21)
where brackets denote a spatial average over the system. We use the same quantity
also to dene the source size for the Hill-type production function. This is especially
well justied if the Hill exponent hin Eq. 2.19 is large.
Next, we analyze our example of a Turing system given by Eq. 2.18 and demonstrate
the absence of scaling. We derive the full hierarchy of steady state patterns and discuss
their existence and stability, thereby going signicantly beyond linear stability analysis
of the homogeneous steady state. This will put us in the position to understand the
mechanisms for scaling of a Turing system.
2.5.1. A hierarchy of steady state solutions
Eq. 2.18 together with the production function in Eq. 2.19 possesses a unique homoge-
neous steady state:
A
h=A=A
1 + (AB=(AB))h; B
h=B=B
1 + (AB=(AB))h: (2.22)
Forh!1 , the steady state concentrations approach zero, A
h=B
h= 0, see Ap-
pendix A.5.
The inhomogeneous steady states can be computed analytically in the limit of h!1 ,
corresponding to the source switch of Eq. 2.20, see Appendix A.6. We nd a hierarchy
of steady state patterns, which can be characterized by the number mof contiguous
source regions with A > B and the number nof source regions touching the system
boundaries, see Fig. 2.6. Any ( m;n)-pattern can be constructed as a concatenation of
= 2m ncopies of the (1 ;1)-pattern as a basic building block, see Appendix A.6. Note
thats==2 is the corresponding leading order Fourier mode of the spatial patterns.

Following the red curve, the source size approaches `=L/B=LforBL. Fur-
thermore, we obtain a threshold for the existence of the (1 ;1)-pattern (green) and a

function of L, when all other parameters are kept constant. Note that an identical
curve could be obtained if instead of L, the length scales AandBwould be varied
via a common control parameter. This will become important in Chapter 3 when we
combine the Turing system with an expander feedback.
The source size is zero in systems that are very small relative to the characteristic
length scales, see Fig. 2.7 (green curve). For these small systems, the homogeneous
steady state is the only existing solution. The (1 ;1)-pattern begins to appear only
above a critical size L1, whereL1obeys

This equation implies in particular that Ahas to be suciently small in comparison
toLandBfor the existence of inhomogeneous patterns, see Appendix A.6.
372. SCALING IN MORPHOGEN SYSTEMS
The relative source size `=Lstrongly increases with LbeyondL1. In the limit of
BL, it eventually saturates, see Fig. 2.7 (blue curve). This observation of source
scaling for an existing (1 ;1)-pattern has been reported before (66, 67, 120). In contrast,
following the red curve for a nite inhibitor range B, the source size `approaches a
constant value independent of L. In the limit BL, we obtain `=L/B=L. The
source does not sense the system boundaries but instead is restricted by B.
Analogous to the (1 ;1)-pattern, any higher order ( m;n)-pattern only exists if the system
sizeLexceeds a critical size L=L1. Fig. 2.8(a) shows the region of existence (gray)
for patterns of dierent pattern numbers.
2.5.2. Higher order patterns form in larger systems
We have shown that the number of coexisting patterns increases with increasing size.
Next, we investigate which of these patterns are stable and can in fact be observed in
systems of dierent sizes.
Higher order modes become linearly unstable in larger systems. | The homogeneous
steady state is linearly unstable with respect to inhomogeneous perturbations for pa-
rameter values that fulll the Turing conditions discussed in Section 1.4. A linear
stability analysis as detailed in Appendix A.5 provides the corresponding parameter
range for our specic choice of Eq. 2.18 and Eq. 2.19. For a certain choice of parame-
ters and a specic system size, there is a range of perturbation modes s2[smin;smax],
which grow exponentially and might result in inhomogeneous patterns. Importantly,
the mode number sscales with system size Las can already be seen from the struc-
ture of the general linear stability matrix in Eq. 1.4. Thus, both interval bounds smin
andsmaxlinearly depend on L as does the mode that becomes unstable rst, when
changing one control parameter. Therefore, in a larger system, more and higher order
perturbation modes become unstable (64, 96, 148).
Nevertheless, the linear instability of the homogeneous steady state is only a necessary
condition for the formation of inhomogeneous patterns. The mode number sof the per-
turbation can provide a rst clue about the type of pattern that might form, yet there
is no general relationship between the growing perturbation modes and nal patterns.
In fact, it is not even clear that an inhomogeneous steady state exists in a system of
nite size, even if the homogeneous steady state is linearly unstable. We encounter
such a situation in our system.

392. SCALING IN MORPHOGEN SYSTEMS
The Turing system possesses a rich dynamics including oscillations due to a nite
system size and the multistability of several steady states. | Fig. 2.8(a) summarizes
size ranges of existence (gray) and stability (black) of steady state patterns of our model.
For very small systems with L<L 1, the homogeneous steady state is the only steady
state pattern that exists in agreement with reecting (and also periodic) boundary
conditions. Still, the homogeneous steady state can be linearly unstable. As there are
no diverging terms in Eq. 2.18, we observe homoclinic orbits and oscillations. These
oscillations induced by boundary eects take place far away from the homogeneous
steady state. Thus, they appear even if all eigenvalues of the linear perturbation matrix
Msare real.
For larger systems with L > L 2, several inhomogeneous steady states coexist and
are linearly stable. We numerically determined the region of linear stability (black)
for several inhomogeneous steady states, see Appendix A.6.4. We did not nd any
upper size limit for the linear stability for a particular pattern. However, we observed
increasingly smaller basins-of-attraction in systems of increasing size. Thus, lower order
patterns become unstable with respect to nite-amplitude perturbations in favor of
higher wavenumber patterns, as exemplied in Fig. 2.8(b).
In conclusion, steady state patterns of increasing wavenumber emerge with increasing
system size. | In particular, the interplay between the characteristic length scales A
andBand the system size Ldetermines whether a certain pattern ts into the system
and whether it will preferentially form. For example, the (1 ;1)-pattern is globally
stable only in a limited size range, see Fig. 2.8(a) (blue shading). Therefore, only if the
system is pinned to this blue region by changing the characteristic length scales with
system size, the (1 ;1)-pattern emerges reliably from arbitrary initial conditions. In a
hypothetical case, in which AandBscale withL, whileAB=(AB) stays constant,
we can hope to nd a range of parameters, for which a particular (1 ;1)-pattern with
a scaling source is the only stable steady state, see Eq. 2.26 and Fig. 2.7. In the next
Chapter, we introduce a corresponding feedback that couples the Turing system to the
dynamics of an expander molecule.
402.6 Summary
2.6. Summary
In this chapter we analyzed scaling of morphogen proles in pre-patterned and self-
organized systems. For this, we especially paid attention to the dierence between
(perfect) scaling of the proles and approximate scaling.
For the case of pre-patterned systems, several scaling mechanisms have been proposed,
drawing on the idea of additional expander molecules, which encode system size (24, 26,
135, 233, 234). We distinguish two classes of scaling mechanisms. In the rst class, the
expander reads out system size independently of the morphogen like in the expander-
dilution model. The second class comprises mechanisms of self-scaling by a feedback
loop between expander and morphogen like in the expansion-repression model. These
latter models typically yield robust approximate scaling but often do not perfectly
scale. We highlight several requirements of such expander feedbacks, in particular the
fact that the amplitude of the morphogen prole has to vary with system size.
As a prototype example for self-organized patterning, we discussed a classical Turing
system with two players. Our specic choice of equations is especially suitable for
analytical treatment. We illustrated the absence of scaling in a comprehensive way:
Besides the linear stability analysis of the homogeneous steady state, we also assessed
existence and stability of the inhomogeneous patterns. We found a hierarchy of in-
homogeneous steady state patterns, for which higher order patterns are favored with
increasing system size. Thereby, the behavior is governed by the ratio of system size
Lto the characteristic length scales AandBof the two considered molecules, indi-
cating that scaling might be achieved by adjusting these length scales with L. In fact
similar ideas have already been explored in earlier works (90, 96, 148, 154). It has been
shown that by coupling AandBto an autonomous chemical size reporter like in the
expander-dilution model, the Turing patterns scale. In Chapter 3, we demonstrate that
we can also devise an expander feedback loop in the spirit of the expansion-repression
model to generate self-organized scaling of a Turing system.
413. Scaling and regeneration
of self-organized patterns
3.1. Self-scaling and self-organization
Flatworms challenge previous theories of pattern scaling and self-organization. Regene-
ration from minute amputation fragments of strongly varying size prompts for patter-
ning mechanisms that are both: scalable and self-organizing. Turing systems, as promi-
nent frameworks for self-organized patterning, do not naturally scale (74, 148, 223).
They typically generate the same patterns repeated multiple times in a growing system
as depicted in Fig. 3.1. In Chapter 2, we have illustrated that this is due to xed
characteristic length scales, which dene the wave length of the patterns.
However, it has been demonstrated that Turing patterns can in fact scale if the charac-
teristic length scales are coupled to a chemical size-reporter, which we called expander
“Everywhere nature works true to scale, and
everything has its proper size accordingly.” —
D’Arcy W. Thompson, On Growth and Form,
1945 (217)(90, 96, 148, 154). These previous works assumed
an expander that is independently controlled by a
pre-patterned system like in Section 2.4.2. Thus,
the proposed mechanisms account for scaling, but
not in a fully self-organized way. Conversely, self-
scaling mechanisms have been discussed previously (e.g. for y development), yet for
systems that are not fully self-organized (11, 24, 27, 223, 234), see Section 2.4.3.
Now, in this chapter, we combine the two features of scaling and self-organization and
present a generic mechanism that yields fully self-organized and self-scaling patterns.
Importantly, the expander feedback in a Turing system with a self-organized source
follows a very dierent control logic than in systems with a pre-existing source. In con-
sequence, perfectly scaling steady states are stable across a wide range of system sizes.
Our novel class of self-scaling Turing patterning provides a conceptual framework to
address scaling and regeneration in atworms and guides the design and interpretation
of experiments. This result has been published in Werner et al. (239).
First, we present a specic example which combines ideas from Turing patterning, dis-
cussed in Section 2.5, with theoretical concepts for the scaling of morphogen proles,

analyzed in Section 2.4. We demonstrate that this system is capable of self-organized
scaling and explain the underlying mechanism. In a second step, we discuss generaliza-
tions of the mechanism and predictions for experiments in atworms.
3.2. A minimal model for self-organized pattern scaling
Analogous to Section 2.4, we add another molecular species, termed expander, whose
concentration Ewill provide a read-out of system size L. As a specic case, we assume
the expander is produced homogeneously, spreads by diusion and is subject to degra-
dation

xE: (3.1)
Again,Edenotes the respective production rate, Ethe degradation rate and DEan
eective diusion coecient.
In order to achieve self-organized scaling, the dynamics of the three molecular species
have to be mutually coupled in a similar manner as for the expander feedback in
Section 2.4.3. As an illustrative example, we choose a feedback loop, in which the
inhibitor of the Turing system controls the degradation rate of the expander via
E=EB (3.2)
with a positive constant E. This choice ensures that the expander concentration is
approximately homogeneous even for small DEbecause the inhibitor concentration
itself is typically rather homogeneous in a Turing system.
In turn, the expander also feeds back on the Turing system and changes the length
scales of the morphogen proles, see Fig. 3.2(a). Analogously to Eq. 3.2, we choose a
linear regulation of the degradation rates by the expander (with A,B>0)
A=AE ; B=BE: (3.3)
Note that Eqs. 2.18 and 3.1 can be considered as a classical three component Turing
system, yet with specically chosen coupling terms given by Eqs. 2.19, 3.2 and 3.3.
433. SCALING & REGENERATION OF SELF-ORGANIZED PATTERNS
3.3. Numeric solution shows scaling and pattern regeneration
Before analyzing this system of equations analytically, we numerically demonstrate that
the steady state pattern scales with system size over several orders of magnitude, see
Fig. 3.2(b)-(c). Small deviations from the perfect collapse of the concentration proles
arise due to a nite diusion coecient of the expander and a nite hof the production
function. Still, the source size `at steady state and the characteristic length scales 
A
and
Bshow almost perfect scaling with system size. In the limit of an homogeneous
expander and a switch-like source with h!1 , we analytically show in Section 3.4
that the scaling becomes exact.
Pattern scaling does not come at the cost of robustness for the Turing system. We
can challenge patterning by perturbations that mimic amputation experiments, see
Fig. 3.2(d). Here, the activator concentration Areliably adjusts to t the smaller
system size. Note that the system part with the initially oversized source and thus
higher morphogen concentrations takes longer to re-adjust.
3.4. Dynamical systems analysis of scaling and regeneration
Next, we provide insight into how and why scaling works. First, we identify steady
states, each of which scales with system size. For the simple case of adiabatically slow
expander dynamics, we then show that the (1,1)-pattern is a stable steady state. A
phase space description allows us to characterize xed points and understand the non-
linear dynamics. We illustrate the behavior by considering a two-dimensional projection
of the phase space of our dynamical system, spanned by the relative source size given
by Eq. 2.21 and the mean expander level, see Fig. 3.3(a).
An implicit scaling relation holds at steady state. | We rst show that all steady
states of the extended Turing system are characterized by the same relative source
size`=L=hPiindependent of system size L. Thus, in Fig. 3.3(a) all steady states
(circles) are found on a horizontal line. By spatial averaging of Eq. 2.18 and 3.1, we
obtain for steady state concentrations BandE
0 =BhPi BhBEi (3.4)

Hence, the relative source size in the steady state is constant

fragment takes signicantly longer due to the initially higher morphogen concentration
(time given in units of 0= 1=pAA). Parameters: DB=DA= 30,DE=DA= 10,

453. SCALING & REGENERATION OF SELF-ORGANIZED PATTERNS
In contrast, the length scales dened in Eq. 2.25 are not constant anymore but change
with expander level:
A=r
DA
AEandB=r
DB
BE: (3.7)
We have seen in Fig. 3.2(c) that 
Aand
Bat steady state scale with high precision
with system size. In order to explain this scaling behavior, we consider the limit
of a spatially homogeneous expander concentration E, for which we can show that
the scaling becomes exact. This limit corresponds to either a large expander range
E=p
DE=(EB)Lor a large inhibitor range B=p
DB=(BE)L. The latter
condition is in compliance with the requirements for a typical Turing system and is
promoted by the scaling feedback.
If the expander level was imposed as constant E=E0, we would obtain a Turing system
without expander feedback, as discussed in Section 2.5. Thus, the concentrations would
converge towards one of the ( m;n)-patterns discussed in Section 2.5.1 with pattern
length scales A(E0) andB(E0). The relative source size f(m;n)=l=Lof such a
pattern depends on E0only via the dimensionless ratios A(E0)=LandB(E0)=L, see
Eq. 2.26. This fact is illustrated by Fig. 2.7, where the red curve displays f(1;1)in the
limit ofh!1 . Importantly, f(m;n)=f(m;n)(L2E0) is only a function of L2E0and
changingE0has analogous eects on the relative source size as changing L2.
The same argument also implies that a ( m;n)-pattern can only exist above a critical
value ofE0, corresponding to the minimum system size for the existence of patterns in
Fig. 2.8(a). Below this critical value, f(m;n)is zero. Above this value, f(m;n)displays
a nonmonotonic dependence on E0, which results from opposing eects of the pattern
length scales of the activator and the inhibitor on the source size `, see Fig. 3.3(a).
The intersections of the curves f(m;n)(obtained from the steady states of the Turing sys-
tem without expander) with the constant value `=Lgiven by Eq. 3.6 dene the steady
states of the full system with expander feedback. For each pattern type ( m;n), we
nd two steady-state patterns, denoted ( m;n)+and (m;n) , with respective expander
levelsE+
(m;n)<E 
(m;n), see the black and white circles in Fig. 3.3(a).
The fact that f(m;n)(L2E) =`=Lis independent of system size Lby Eq. 3.6, implies
that alsoL2Eis independent of Lfor each steady state. We conclude E/L 2and

`=L=f(m;n)(L2E) for some ( m;n), corresponding to the fast time scale of the Turing
system. Then, by Eq. 3.1, the system moves slowly along this nullcline according to
@tE=E EB
Bf(m;n)(L2E): (3.8)
Stability of steady-state patterns requires @Ef(m;n)>0, which is observed to hold only
forE+
(m;n), see Fig. 3.3(a).
Which branch f(m;n)is selected for arbitrary initial conditions by the fast Turing dy-
namics? As we consider the limit of slow expander feedback, the expander concentra-
tion is approximately constant within the time scale of the Turing relaxation. Thus,
the question of which pattern ( m;n) is selected is formally equivalent to the stability
of (m;n)-patterns in the Turing system without expander feedback as a function of
system size L. The blue region in Fig. 2.8(a), in which the (1 ;1)-pattern is the only
stable pattern, can be associated with the blue range of expander concentration in
Fig. 3.3(a). Therefore, we can deduce that this represents a basin-of-attraction for the
(1;1)+-pattern.
A numerical analysis reveals a large basin-of-attraction for the rst order pattern. |
Fig. 3.3(c) shows that the (1 ;1)+-pattern is an attractive xed point also for trajectories
starting outside this blue region and for nonadiabatic expander dynamics. Two example
trajectories, labelled ( i) and ( ii), corresponding to head and tail fragments, respectively,
converge to the (1 ;1)-pattern, after a transient under- and over-shoot of the source size.
Two additional trajectories, labeled ( iii) and ( iv), simulating uniform injection of the
expander, likewise converge to this xed point. We can understand these observations
by drawing on the results for the Turing system without expander in Section 2.5.1 and
2.5.2.
The dynamics for large expander concentrations are characterized by a successive move-
ment through higher order patterns. | The (1;1)+-state is also attractive for trajec-
tories like ( iv) with initially high values of E. Here, a (2 ;2)-pattern with an additional
source is transiently emerging. Yet, according to the expander dynamics given by
Eq. 3.8, the system moves towards the xed point (2 ;2)+as long as the (2 ;2)-pattern
comprises a stable xed point of the Turing system without expander. However, the
xed point (2 ;2)+of the Turing system with expander lies in a region of the phase
space where the (2 ;2)-pattern of the Turing system alone is unstable for our choice
of parameters. Thus, the xed point (2 ;2)+is in fact a saddle point, attractive with
respect to the expander dynamics along the nullcline f(2;2)but unstable with respect
to the Turing system. Again, this can be understood from Fig. 2.8(a) by noting the
483.4 Dynamical systems analysis of scaling and regeneration
formal correspondence between changes in Efor a xed system size Land changes in
L2for the classical Turing system without expander. Fig. 2.8(a) illustrates that the
(2;2)-pattern is unstable outside the blue region. The result would be dierent for the
(1;0)-pattern. Note that the nullclines of the (1 ;0)-pattern and the (2 ;2)-pattern are
congruent in our projection of the phase space. In consequence, there exists a trajectory
starting with a (1 ;0)-pattern that looks identical to ( iv), besides the fact that it ends
in the xed point (1 ;0)+, which is stable for our choice of parameters, as illustrated in
Fig. 2.8(a).
Dynamics of homogeneous states allows to understand regeneration of patterns. |
For small expander values, there are no inhomogeneous steady state patterns of the
Turing system, yet homogeneous patterns exist. To understand the relaxation of the
full system, we will discuss two limiting cases, assuming again the separation of time
scales between Turing dynamics and expander system:
a) In the limit of fast Turing dynamics, the Turing system will rst approach the
homogeneous steady state, given by Eq. 2.22 for a certain value of E. On the larger time
scale of the expander relaxation, the system moves along the corresponding nullcline
`=L=f(0;0)according to
@tE=E BE

h;B
h): (3.9)
Iff(0;0)<`=L, the expander level increases and consequently the Turing length scale
decreases until the homogeneous pattern becomes unstable and inhomogeneous patterns
can form.
b) As a second case, we consider the opposite limit, for which the Turing dynamics are
adiabatically slow and the inhibitor concentration Bdoes hardly change within the time
scale of relaxation of the expander towards E=(EB). We nd a qualitatively similar
behavior. It exists another homogeneous, yet dynamic solution of the Turing system,
in which the ratio =B=A and thusP(A;B) =g() is approximately constant. The
ratiois determined by the following implicit relation, see Appendix A.7.1:

@tB=Bg() BE
E; (3.11)
this requires that g()<`=L.
493. SCALING & REGENERATION OF SELF-ORGANIZED PATTERNS
Depending on the choice of parameters, both transient homogeneous states (corre-
sponding to the two limiting cases of a separation of time scales) can be observed when
mimicking regeneration experiments in the Turing system with expander. In Fig. 3.3(c),
the horizontal stretch of trajectory ( i) corresponds to g(). Both production terms f(0;0)
andg() of the transient homogeneous states have to be smaller than `=L, explaining
the transient undershoot during regeneration. Note that from g() =`=Lfollows that
alsof(0;0)=`=L. The set of parameters corresponding to this joint condition mark the
breakdown of robust regeneration, see horizontal line in Fig. 3.3(d). Beyond this thres-
hold, the homogeneous morphogen concentrations diverge while the expander vanishes
(purple region). If the parameters obey this constraint, the basin-of-attraction of the
(1;1)-state extends towards small values of Eoutside the blue region in Fig. 3.3(a).
3.5. As single source pattern is attractive for a large region of
the phase space
Based on the discussion above, we expect the (1 ;1)-pattern to be re-established even
when simulating more drastic amputation experiments, as shown in Fig. 3.4. Again,
we nd the source `=Lof each smaller system rst approaching the horizontal line
corresponding to g(). Eventually, the expander value is suciently large such that
the homogeneous state becomes unstable and inhomogeneous patterns can form. Tran-
siently, the (2 ;1)-pattern arises but as the (2 ;1)+-solution is unstable with respect to
the Turing dynamics, the additional source vanishes and the system returns to the
(1;1)-pattern.
Details of the relaxation dynamics and whether (1 ;1)+is the only stable xed point or
whether a second stable xed point (1 ;0)+with a smaller basin-of-attraction exists like
in our example, depends on the choice of parameters. In general, we observe robust
pattern scaling for a vast parameter range, provided (i) inhibitor diusion is suciently
fast (a necessary condition for pattern formation in any Turing system) and (ii) the
feedback strength is similar for both Turing molecules, see Fig. 3.3(d). The threshold
above which the expander concentration vanishes, resulting in a divergence of AandB
(purple), can be analytically determined from the condition f(0;0)=g() =`=L. This
corresponds to the fact that the expander should increase for homogeneous morphogen
concentrations.

3.6. Structural robustness for pattern scaling
Several generalizations of the proposed minimal mechanism are conceivable. First, the
feedback of the Turing system on the expander level could be likewise implemented via
the production rate, e.g. E/B, instead via the degradation rate E=EB. Then,
scaling would require A/1=E; B/1=Eas well as a fast spreading expander,
yielding analogous steady states.
As a second possibility for pattern scaling, the feedback in Eq. 3.3 could also be medi-
ated byA(instead of Bor additional to B), provided the expander diuses suciently
fast. For example, the following system can be interpreted in the sense that pairs of A

More generally, the degradation term does not even have to be linear in A,BandE.
Two increasing functions of AandE, andBandE, respectively, that fulll the Turing
conditions together with P(A;B) are sucient to generate robust scaling by the same
arguments as above, see Appendix A.7.2.
Remarkably, the feedback loop considered here, featuring two mutually suppressing
concentration proles ( BandE), would be unstable for a pre-patterned morphogen
source of xed size as discussed for the expander feedback in Section 2.4.3. The feedback
mechanism becomes stable, only due to the self-stabilizing eect of the Turing system
itself.
Our mechanism yields pattern scaling by scaling of the morphogen proles via a feed-
back on the degradation rates of AandB. As discussed in Section 2.3, scaling of expo-
nential proles can in principle also be achieved by mechanisms aecting the diusion of
morphogens. However, controlling only diusion is not compatible with self-organized
pattern scaling as presented here. Our mechanism relies on a size-dependent amplitude
of the morphogen proles, which is lacking for pure diusion control, as discussed in
Section 2.4.5.
The morphogen amplitude in our feedback scheme changes quadratically with system
size as can be seen from Eq. 2.23-2.24. It is interesting to note that the ux AAhas
a size-independent amplitude. The spatial prole of this ux could provide a read-out
of the scaling morphogen proles independent of their amplitudes, see Appendix A.7.3.
For example, if degradation only happens by internalization upon binding to a receptor,
the concentration of down-stream targets of the morphogen Awould be proportional
to the ux AA.
523.7 Signatures of self-scaling patterns
3.7. Signatures of self-scaling patterns
Our minimal model for the scaling of self-organized patterns can act as a framework
to understand scaling and regeneration in atworms. We nd a number of signatures
characterizing this class of patterning mechanism, which can be identied in experi-
ments.
(i) First, the over-all morphogen levels depend on system size. As already discussed
in Section 2.4.5 for self-scaling feedback loops, this is necessary for the morphogens
to inuence the expander in a size-dependent manner. However, downstream targets
might scale with a constant amplitude.
(ii) Second, for the simple scalable Turing systems discussed here, a size-dependent
morphogen amplitude requires the adjustment of degradation rates. For the experi-
ments, we have to take into account that many processes can eectively lead to a
change in degradation by expander molecules. For example, binding of the expander
could disintegrate or alter the morphogen such that it cannot fulll its signaling task.
Alternatively, the expander could act as a co-receptor that facilitates internalization
and thus removes the morphogen from the system. Conversely, the expander might
reduce degradation by preventing disintegration, modications or internalization by
binding to the morphogen or its suppressors.
(iii) Third, the expander by denition shows a size-dependent concentration. If the
expander level is proportionally to L2, it can couple linearly to the degradation rate
to achieve scaling. Note that the expander is likely not a single molecule but an entire
signaling module, for which some components might already be expressed in a size-
dependent manner. Thus, analyzing changes in expression levels between animals of
dierent size can help to identify the expander mechanism.
(iv) Fourth, a perturbation of the expander feedback by over-expression or gene knock-
out or also by hindered spreading is expected to lead to a change in the wave number of
the pattern. Depending on the coupling of the expander to the morphogen dynamics,
one might observe the most severe eects in either small or large animals.
(v) Fifth, the source is expected to exhibit a non-monotonic dynamics after ampu-
tation. In particular, an initially oversized source might show an undershoot during
regeneration.
(vi) Sixth, there might be additional xed points of the system with small basins-of-
attraction. In our example, the (1 ;0)+-pattern was also stable and locally attractive.
If the system is initialized close to this pattern, the pattern will be maintained, even in
the presence of small perturbations.
533. SCALING & REGENERATION OF SELF-ORGANIZED PATTERNS
3.8. Comparison to experiments in atworms
The signatures discussed in Section 3.7 can to some extent be found in atworms, in
particular for the Wnt/ -catenin pathway associated with head-tail polarity (4, 9, 51,
54, 81, 82, 141, 160). The Wnt molecules are expressed in the posterior part of the
animal and shape the graded -catenin prole with a maximum at the tail, see Fig. 3.5.
The expression regions of components of the Wnt pathway as well as independent
anterior and posterior markers t to the size of the worm (81). Furthermore, rst
preliminary data by our experimental collaborators suggests that also the -catenin
prole matches worm size with a constant amplitude, see (i).
After amputation, this graded cue has to be quickly scaled to t the remaining body
fragment. Indeed, it has been observed that the position-dependent expression pattern
along the AP axis changes within the existing cells to adjust to the new fragment size
in the course of a few days (81, 82, 245). Thus, the robust re-establishment of a scaled
chemical pattern seems to predate the remodelling of the body plan. Thereby, the
expression region of one of the Wnt molecules is reported to show similar dynamics as
the source size in our model, see (v). After cutting the worm, the expression of Wnt11.5
is strongly reduced and undershoots its target range before it eventually scales up again
to t the fragment size (81).
Knockdown of -catenin leads to the formation of multiple heads (3, 51, 82, 82, 160).
Interestingly, after a transient drug treatment, the double-headed phenotype persists
even after consecutive amputations (117). This agrees with our discussed example for
which one second order pattern (and even more specically the (1 ;0)-pattern) seems to
be a locally attractive xed point, see (vi).
Additionally, very narrow slices of the worm can also sometimes result in a double-
headed phenotype (4, 51, 117, 127). Again, this compares to our model, for which
the morphogen prole transiently attens after amputation. In the model, the prole
becomes the more homogeneous the smaller the fragment. Starting from a homogeneous
prole can occasionally result in the emergence of a higher order pattern with a small
basin-of-attraction, see (vi).
Candidates for the expander molecules still have to be identied. However, a rst
sequencing screen by our experimental collaborators found several genes which are
expressed in a size-dependent manner. Some of them are even approximately homoge-
neously expressed and show a strong (possibly quadratic) dependence on worm length,
see (iii).

For a homogeneous eect of the expander on the morphogen, the expander might be
a rather small and fast diusion molecule. Such small molecules could for example
quickly travel between cells via gap junctions. Interesting, it has been reported that the
blocking of gap junctions in atworms leads to body patterns with a larger wavelength
(152), see (iv).
In summary, we could identify several signatures of our simple model, which help us to
lay out the route for further experiments such as targeted gene knockouts. Thereby, it
is important not to confuse patterns with processes. The same steady state pattern can
arise from very dierent underlying mechanisms. This is particularly true for the case
of Turing models (147). Already for a simple three component model as we discussed
in this chapter, the knockout of activator or inhibitor might easily provoke misleading
interpretations of the data, see Appendix A.7.4. Considering not an endpoint assay but
a time course of the system after amputations or gene knockouts might to some extent
circumvent this problem. The dynamics typically reveal additional, valuable details
that might enable us to distinguish between dierent mechanisms.
553. SCALING & REGENERATION OF SELF-ORGANIZED PATTERNS
3.9. Summary and discussion
In this chapter, we introduced a new class of pattern forming mechanisms, which gene-
rate patterns that perfectly scale with system size in a completely self-organized manner.
The patterning scheme relies on expander molecules that dynamically adjust the degra-
dation rates of morphogens in a Turing system. Thereby, the expander controls the
pattern length scales and the source size of the resulting Turing patterns. Conversely,
the expander concentration is dynamic itself and is regulated by the concentrations
of the Turing morphogens. For the feedback introduced here, the relative source size
at steady state is always independent of the system size, see Eq. 3.6. Furthermore,
we showed that a head-tail polarity pattern with a single source region scales as a
function of the system size, is stable with respect to perturbations, and regenerates in
amputation fragments.
Previous works have already discussed scaling of morphogen proles and patterns in
pre-patterned systems. Either the morphogen source was specied by other pre-existing
cues (24, 26) or the morphogen prole was self-organized according to a Turing mecha-
nism but scaling relied on a predened geometry (90, 96, 148, 154). Such frameworks
are challenged by the regeneration capabilities of atworms. In addition, we will show
in Chapter 5 that the length-width ratio of the worms does not stay constant during
growth, which is also not compatible with mechanisms relying on a xed geometry.
Now, our self-organized model for pattern scaling is able to read out system size in
the absence of any pre-patterns and without strong dependence on specic geometrical
features.
Certainly, body plan patterns in atworms do not emerge in the total absence of po-
tential pre-patterning cues. For example, it has been shown that the contact of dorsal
and ventral tissue at the wound site causes a regeneration response (102). Still, our
self-organized patterning system captures main characteristics of body plan scaling and
regeneration in atworms and allows to discuss generic concepts. Thereby, it provides
the basis for further investigations and more sophisticated modeling approaches.
In the minimal theory formulated here, we neglected spontaneous expander degradation.
Such spontaneous degradation would cap the expander concentration and set a lower
size limit for pattern scaling. Additionally, in size-monitoring systems as considered
here, a key challenge relates to the simple fact that these obviously require long-range
communication across the scale of the system. This implies a trade-o between an
upper size limit for scaling, and the time-scale of pattern formation. Here, this time
scale is set by morphogen diusion and system size. For example, assuming a maximum
563.9 Summary and discussion
diusion coecient of 100 m2/s and a maximum organism size of 20 mm, relevant
for the atworms considered, we infer a patterning time scale of 3  30 days, roughly
consistent with the experimental range of 1  2 weeks for the restoration of body plan
proportions after amputation (4, 140). Note that active, non-directional transport in
addition to passive diusion could accelerate morphogen dispersal and thus allow for
faster pattern formation (76).
In fact, it has been suggested for atworms that fast long-range communication might be
implemented via gap junctions or the central nervous system (9, 152, 157). Besides the
transmission of actual nervous signals, a molecular transport along the nerve cords was
proposed (9, 169, 245). Moreover, a gradient of membrane voltage has been discussed
to mediate long range patterning and scaling of body parts (22, 23, 115). Yet, even
when considering faster transport processes than normal diusion, eventually we can
expect a physical limit to scaling, which would be revealed by the emergence of higher
order body plan patterns. Interestingly, it has been reported that a second head forms
in very large animals of some species (50, 98).
So far, we were mainly concerned with the Wnt/ -catenin system and the gradient for-
mation along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Yet, there are also two additional axes,
which are specied by other signaling molecules (141). For example, the Admp/Bmp
system appears to be responsible for the establishment of a dorsal and a ventral side
(61). In atworms, these molecules seem to cross-react analogous to a Turing system.
Previously, they have also been proposed to be a Turing pair in the frog Xenopus laevis
(122) and a shuttling mechanism has been discussed as a means to adjust the Bmp
gradient to the size of the frog embryo (25).
The theory developed in this chapter provides a framework to understand robust axis
formation and scalable body plan patterning. In the future, it will be important to test
the generic concepts presented here in regeneration experiments and to quantify spatial
proles of signaling molecules and genetic activity. With this, we aim to identify the
key modules leading to scaling and regeneration.
574. Flatworm shape dynamics and motility
4.1. Modes, movement and morphology
While the previous chapters were concerned with the patterning of a specic body
layout, this chapter aims to analyze motility-induced and inter-species variations of the
body shapes as a rst step to relate form and function. Ultimately, we would like to
understand why worms look and behave the way they do. Most of the results of this
chapter have been published in Werner et al. (238).
Evolutionary adaption to a specic environment manifests itself in the emergence
of characteristic body morphologies, which among others allow the organism to e-
ciently sense its environment and steer its path. Thus, motility phenotypes reveal
abnormal body plan patterns. Flatworms usually display a smooth gliding motility,
“Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his ﬂight, or
the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse,
the blithe swan, the branching oak, the win-
ding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over
all the coursing sun, form ever follows function,
and this is the law.” — Louis H. Sullivan,
The Tall Ofﬁce Building Artistically Considered,
1896 (210)resulting from a coordinated beating of the cilia
in their densely ciliated ventral epithelium (8, 169,
179, 180). For the cilia to act in synchrony, they
have to be oriented in parallel to each other, which
is coordinated by a structural polarity of the epi-
thelial cells in the plane of the epithelial tissue.
This planar cell polarity system (PCP) comprises
several molecules that asymmetrically localize to
the anterior or posterior side of each cell, respectively, and bind through the membrane
to the corresponding counterpart in the neighbouring cells (51, 196, 226). It has been
described that the PCP system, which is based on local cell-cell interactions, couples to
global polarity cues provided by organism-scale / tissue-scale concentration gradients
of signaling molecules as discussed in the previous chapter (51, 196, 226). Together
with our experimental collaborators, we aim to explore this coupling by quantifying
the gliding speed after knocking out genes of the Wnt/ -catenin pathway as a long
range patterning system.
In a second approach, we analyze and characterize the movement patterns of atworms
in detail. How do the worms steer their path? We nd that a characteristic bending
posture correlates with active turning during gliding, presumably caused by unilateral
584.1 Modes, movement and morphology
muscle contractions. Thus, during gliding motility, speed is generated by beating cilia
whereas steering is controlled by muscles. Occasionally, atworms also show a second
type of motility behavior, called \inch-worming", sometimes also referred to as \peri-
staltic movement" (8, 169, 179, 180). Switching to this motility mode is associated
with escape responses and impaired cilia functionality. We characterize inch-worming
by stereotypic width changes of these worms. Our method reveals regular lateral con-
traction waves with a period of about 4 s in inch-worming worms. Since then, body
contractions have been further analyzed and a recent publication reports on distinct
dierences between \scrunching" as a quick escape response and \peristalsis" as a more
persistent gait if cilia functionality is impaired (38). We will compare these results to
our previous ndings.
Finally, we employ shape analysis methods to characterize the morphologies of various
atworm species, which come at very dierent shapes and sizes. The taxonomic identi-
cation is usually challenging, relying largely on the time-consuming mapping of inter-
nal characters. Here, we illustrate how to systematically and quantitatively distinguish
dierent atworm species by head shape. The head is one of the most characteristic
external hallmarks of the atworm body plan. Many sensory organs for various stimuli
(e.g. light, temperature, touch, chemical signals) are located in the head (21, 95). This
includes two eyespots and the auricles with a high density of nerve cells. Yet, also
other, less prominent shape characteristics might be crucial for the worm to survive,
for example by allowing for more ecient movement and navigation. The systematic
characterization and quantitative comparison of body plan morphologies provides the
basis for relating worm shape to tness of a species in its specic environmental niche
(103, 199).
We analyzed the motility patterns of Smed and head shapes of dierent atworm species
using shape mode analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA) (97, 99, 156).
The technique has been previously applied to biological data to e.g. analyze the dy-
namics of human arm postures, crawling C. elegans worms or swimming sperm cells
(58, 118, 189, 207, 208, 209). In contrast to those examples, which are well described by
their center line, the atworm body is constantly deforming during movement depend-
ing on the contraction of their muscular plexus due to the absence of skeletal elements
or a rigid body wall. Thus, we adapted PCA to analyze and quantify motility patterns
of a closed non-convex boundary outline.
The starting point of PCA is typically a large data set comprising Nameasurements
ofNbfeatures. An example would be the curvature at Nbdiscrete positions along
594. FLATWORM SHAPE DYNAMICS AND MOTILITY
a winding worm at Natime points. In biological data sets the individual features
are often correlated, e.g. the curvature at adjacent positions is similar due to a nite
stiness of the body. Therefore, the data might be well described by a much smaller
set of characteristic shape modes. For example a sine wave might be a good rst
approximation to the wiggling of a worm. The most descriptive shape modes are
found in a systematic way by determining the largest variations in the data set. At
best, a small number of empirical modes characterizes most of the data and can be
interpreted in a meaningful way. As a side-eect, this method reduces measurement
noise by averaging over several, partially redundant features. PCA can also be seen as
a rotation of the phase-space coordinate system such that it is more suitable for the
data at hand. Afterwards, the data can be projected with only negligible information
loss onto a subset of the phase-space spanned by a small number of axes. These axes
correspond to the shape modes.
4.2. Worm motility reports on patterning defects upon gene
knockout
We analyze movies of gliding worms as described in Appendix C and extract the center
line of the worm body. The midpoint of the center line is tracked to determine the
median worm speed. We observe that wild type worms actively regulate their gliding
speed up to a maximum of 2 mm/s with a weak dependence on size, see black circles
in Fig. 4.1(a). The range in speed is in quantitative agreement with earlier works
inSmed and Dugesia tigrina (155, 212). Next, we compare this result to the speed
of modied worms, for which pathway components of the Wnt/ -catenin patterning
system have been silenced by RNA interference (RNAi). Imaging of wild type worms
has been performed by Nicole Alt under the supervision of the author. The RNAi
experiments have been performed by Sarah Mansour in the group of Jochen Rink (two
RNAi feedings per week). All analysis has been done by the author.
The canonical Wnt/ -catenin signaling cascade is illustrated in Fig. 4.1(b) (82, 107). In
the absence of canonical Wnts, -catenin is degraded by a destruction complex, which
includes APC as a key component. If Wnt ligands bind to the Frizzled receptors, the
destruction complex is inhibited via Dishevelled (Dvl). Thus, -catenin can accumulate
in the cell and reach the nucleus to control transcription. Canonical Wnt/ -catenin
signaling has been associated with tail formation (82). Knockout of Dvl by RNAi
feedings leads to the emergence of multiple heads, while knockout of APC leads to the
formation of a second tail after head amputation.

614. FLATWORM SHAPE DYNAMICS AND MOTILITY
In intact worms, we observe a motility phenotype for APC RNAi, see colored points in
Fig. 4.1(a). Worm speed is reduced over the course of the experiment. We can quantify
this trend for two size classes and see a signicant eect already after two weeks of
RNAi feeding, see Fig. 4.1(c). It remains to determine whether APC acts directly on
the PCP pathway or whether a graded -catenin signal is required to maintain planar
cell polarity.
Similarly, when knocking down both Dvl genes of Smed , we observe a reduced speed
suggesting a disoriented cilia carpet, see Fig. 4.1(d). In fact, it is known that Dvl is not
only a component of the canonical Wnt signaling cascade, leading to a translocation
of-catenin to the nucleus, Dvl also acts in non-canonical Wnt signaling, where it
activates the PCP pathway (8, 60, 107). It has been shown that silencing Dvl leads to
a less, shorter and more disorganized cilia (8, 9).
In order to determine to what extent non-canonical Wnt signaling is related to PCP in
atworms, Sarah Mansour performed RNAi of Wnt2 and Wnt5. Unlike the canonical
tail Wnts, Wnt2 is expressed in the head and Wnt5 is expressed around the body
margin and especially along the central nervous system (9, 81). Especially Wnt5 has
been discussed to act in non-canonical signaling in atworms and is also involved in
PCP systems of other organisms (9, 59). Fig. 4.1(e) shows no movement phenotype for
Wnt2 RNAi, but Wnt5 RNAi results in a signicant reduction in speed. Interestingly,
the Wnt5 phenotype is rather subtle. While for APC and Dvl RNAi, the worms seem
to loose the ability to glide, switch to inch-worming motility and eventually cease being
motile altogether, the Wnt5 RNAi worms are still capable of normal gliding motion, just
slower. It is an interesting question, whether this is due to an incomplete knockdown
or the particular eect of Wnt5 on the PCP system.
In summary, analyzing worm movement upon RNAi is a simple and non-lethal approach
to identify patterning phenotypes. The method reveals even subtle eects as for Wnt5
and inspires further more elaborate measurements of cilia orientation and gene expres-
sion proles.
624.3 Shape mode analysis of 2D worm outlines
4.3. Shape mode analysis of 2D worm outlines
Next, we analyze the behavioral repertoire of atworms in greater detail. Dierent
movement strategies are reected in bending of the worm body. Due to the large body
plasticity, motility-induced changes in body posture are not well described by only
the center line but require an analysis of the perimeter dynamics. Thus, we face the
challenge of characterizing the shape of closed, planar curves. For non-convex shapes,
this can be non-trivial.
We extract the midline and the perimeter of the worms from movie sequences as de-
scribed in Appendix C, see Fig. 4.2(a). The imaging has been performed by Nicole Alt
under the supervision of the author. The worm shape corresponds to a closed curve
described by a position vector r(s) as a function of arc-length salong its circumference,
see Fig. 4.2(b). We use the tip of the worm tail as a distinguished reference point r1that
species the position of s= 0. We further specify a center point r0, using the midpoint
of the tracked center line of the worms. The prole of radial distances (s) =jr(s) r0j
measured with respect to the center point r0characterizes outline shape, even for non-
convex outlines. Shapes of convex curves might also be characterized by a prole of
radial distances (') as a function of a polar angle '. However, this denition does
not generalize to non-convex curves (or, more precisely, to curves that are not radially
convex with respect to r0). To adjust for dierent worm sizes, we normalize the radial
distance proles by the mean radius =h(s)ias ^=(s)=and plot it as a function
of normalized arc-length ^ s=s=L, whereLis the total length of the circumference.
As a mathematical side-note, we remark that using the signed curvature (s) = (@2
sr(s))
(@sr(s)) along the circumference, instead of the radial distance prole (s), would
amount to a signicant disadvantage: The property that a certain curvature prole
corresponds to a closed curve imposes a non-trivial constraint on the set of admissi-
ble curvature proles. For the normalized radial distance proles, however, there is
a continuous range of distance proles that correspond to closed curves, making this
choice of denition more suitable for applying linear decomposition techniques such
as shape mode analysis. In fact, given a particular normalized radial distance prole,
the corresponding circumference length L=is reconstructed self-consistently by the
requirement that the associated curve must close on itself, see Appendix D.1.

the boundary outline corresponding to the superposition of the mean worm shape and
this rst shape mode (solid red: B1= 1, dashed red: B1= 1, black: mean shape

the third shape mode corresponds to unlike deformations of head and tail ( B3= 0:8),
giving the worm a wedge-shaped appearance. (e) The rst shape mode with score B1,
describing worm bending, strongly correlates with the instantaneous turning rate of
worm midpoint trajectories. (f) We manually selected 30 movies where worms clearly

644.4 Shape dynamics during crawling and inchworming
4.4. Shape dynamics during crawling and inchworming
4.4.1. A bending mode and two width-changing modes
We extracted Nw= 29 993 worm outlines from a total of 745 analyzed movies. We
computed normalized radial distance proles as described above, each prole being
represented by Nr= 200 radii, resulting in a large NwNrdata matrixRi;j= ^i(sj).
From the average of all radial proles, we dene a mean worm shape that averages out
shape variations ^ 0(s) =PNw
i=1^i(s)=Nw, see Fig. 4.2(d) (right inset, black). From this,
we can devise a NwNrmatrixR0
i;j= [^0;:::; ^0], for which all the rows are equal to
the mean prole. Next, we computed the NrNrcovariance matrix
C= (R R0)T(R R0) (4.1)
between the individual radial proles, using the centered (mean-corrected) data ma-
trix, see Fig. 4.2(c). The covariance matrix is by construction symmetric along the
dashed line. The approximate symmetry of the covariance matrix along the dotted
diagonal shows that shape variations are statistically symmetric with respect to the
worm midline. For example the worm bends as often to the left as to the right.
TheNreigenvectors vj(s) or shape modes of this covariance matrix correspond to
axes of a new coordinate system. In this coordinate system, the variation of the data
along each axis is linearly uncorrelated and the corresponding variance is given by the
respective eigenvalue. The shape modes with the largest eigenvalues are those with
maximal descriptive power. We can uniquely express the worm shape as
^(s) =NrX
j=1Bjvj(s); (4.2)
where the shape scores Bjcan be computed by a linear least-square t. Due to corre-
lations, many data sets can be well described by a truncated sum, using only a small
number of shape modes with the largest eigenvalues.
Fig. 4.2(d) shows the rst three shape modes, which together account for 94% of the ob-
served variation in shape. We nd that the dominant shape mode v1is anti-symmetric,
describing an overall bending of the worm. In contrast, the second and third mode de-
scribe symmetric width changes of the worm: The second shape mode v2characterizes
a lateral thinning of the worm associated with a pointy head and tail. Correspondingly,
a negative contribution of the second shape mode with B2<0 describes lateral thicke-
ning of the worm (with a slightly more roundish head and tail). The third shape mode
654. FLATWORM SHAPE DYNAMICS AND MOTILITY
v3, nally, is associated with unlike deformations of head and tail, giving the worm
a wedge-like appearance. Superpositions of these three shape modes describe in-plane
bending of the worms, and a complex width dynamics of head and tail.
We nd that shape changes control the direction of gliding motility and thus steer the
worm's path: Fig. 4.2(e) displays a signicant correlation between the rate of turning
along the worm trajectory and the rst shape score B1, which characterizes bending
of the worm. The sign and magnitude of this \bending score" directly relates to the
direction and rate of turning. For simplicity, we restricted the analysis to a medium
size range of 8-10 mm length, analogous results are found for other size classes.
4.4.2. The second and third modes characterize inch-worming
In addition to cilia-driven gliding motility, atworms employ a second, cilia-independent
motility pattern known as inch-worming, which provides a back-up motility system in
case of dysfunctional cilia (8, 169, 179, 180). We test whether modes two and three
might relate to this second motility pattern. For this, we analyzed movies of small
worms known to engage more frequently in this kind of behaviour. We manually clas-
sied 80 movies of worms smaller than 0 :9 mm that had been starved for 10 weeks,
yielding a number 30 inch-worming and 50 non-inch-worming worms for a dierentiated
motility analysis (cases of ambiguity were not included). We nd that the second and
third shape mode, which characterize dynamic variations in body width, are indeed
more pronounced in inch-worming worms, see Fig. 4.2(f). Next, we computed the tem-
poral autocorrelation of time series of the second shape mode B3, see Fig. 4.2(g) (solid
blue). We observe stereotypical shape oscillations with a characteristic frequency of
0.26 Hz. From the cross-correlation between B3andB2in Fig. 4.2G (dashed black),
we nd that both shape scores oscillate with a common frequency and relative phase lag
of 0:6(whereB2lags behind). Thus, both shape modes act together in an orches-
trated manner to facilitate inch-worming, hinting at coordinated muscle movements
and periodic neuronal activity patterns.
4.5. Discriminating atworm species by shape
After having developed tools to measure shape changes of the same species over time, we
next explored the utility of shape mode analysis for comparing dierent species. The
model species Schmidtea mediterranea is but one of many hundred atworm species
existing worldwide (50, 116). We aim to introduce shape mode analysis as a technique

dierent atworm species. For each species, time-lapse sequences of 4 dierent worms
were recorded as two independent runs of 16 frames each. The head is dened as
the most anterior 20% of the worm body. Radial distances (s) are computed with
respect to the midpoint of the head (red dot at 10% of the worm length from the
tip of the head). (b) By applying PCA to this multi-species data set, we obtain two
shape modes, which together account for 88% of the shape variability. Deformations
of the mean shape with respect to the the two modes are shown (black: mean shape,
red: superposition of mean shape and rst mode with B1=0:4 and second mode
withB2=0:2, respectively). We represent head morphology of the four species in
a combined shape space of these two modes. Average head shapes for each species
are indicated by crosses, with ellipses of variance including 68% (dark color) and 95%
(light color) of motility-associated shape variability, respectively. (Imaging by Nicole
Alt and Miquel Vila-Farr e, data analysis by the author)
to facilitate taxonomic classication of these species. PCA enables us to extract typi-
cal shape variations between species without \a priori" assumptions on characteristic
features.
Having available a large live collection of atworm species, we choose four species repre-
senting the genera Girardia ,Phagocata ,Schmidtea and Polycelis . Besides potentially
size-dependent variations in aspect ratio, the four species dier by their characteristic
head shapes, see Fig. 4.3(a). Accordingly, we restrict the shape analysis to the head
region only (dened as the most anterior 20% of the worm body). In analogy to the
procedure described above for the full worm body, we characterize each head shape by
a vector of distances from the midpoint of the head (red dot, 10% of the worm length
from the tip of the head) to the outline (s) of the head region. Next, PCA is applied
to the normalized radial distance proles like before.
674. FLATWORM SHAPE DYNAMICS AND MOTILITY
We found that the rst two eigenmodes captured 88% of head shape variability within
this multi-species data set. Fig. 4.3(b) shows species-specic mean shapes for each
of the four species in a combined head shape space, as well as ellipses of variance
covering 68% (dark color) and 95% (light color) of motility-associated shape variability,
respectively. Shape reconstruction from individual modes is explained in Appendix D.2.
The rst mode seems to describe the extent of the auricles while the second mode can
be associated with the auricle position. This comparison of atworm species represen-
ting four genera illustrates linear dimensionality reduction as a simple means to map
morphological dierences across species.
4.6. Discussion
In this chapter, we have discussed several approaches to relate form and function in
atworms focussing on motility. Movement patterns are generated by various features
of the body plan such as cilia and muscle layout. By analyzing worm motility, we gained
rst insights into their functionality and coordination. In a rst approach, we measured
worm speed in wild type and RNAi treated animals and could quantify subtle motility
phenotypes, which hint at patterning defects of the PCP system.
In a second approach, we analyzed the shape variations during movement, adapting
principal component analysis in order to apply it to 2D outlines. We characterized
inchworming as a second motility mode, dierent from cilia-based gliding motility,
which is driven by well-coordinated muscle contractions with a characteristic frequency
of about 0:26 Hz. In a recent work, contractile motility gaits have been further analyzed
(38). Cochet-Escartin et al. distinguish between two behavioral traits: (i) scrunching
as a transient and fast response to cutting as well as electrical, acidic and temperature
shocks, (ii) peristalsis as a more persistent and slow movement strategy if cilia func-
tionality is impaired. The authors could induce the latter in two dierent ways: (i)
by RNAi of the iguana gene leading to defective ciliogenesis and (ii) by increasing the
viscosity of the media (by adding 16% coll). Interestingly, they extracted frequen-
cies of the area oscillations during peristalsis and obtain 0 :280:03 Hz (iguana) and
0:260:02Hz (coll), respectively. These values are very similar to our result. To-
gether, the three conditions illustrate a very generic inchworming/peristalsis behavior
despite their higher level of complexity compared to other model organisms such as C.
elegans (173, 184, 208, 244). It remains to determine how this relates to the underlying
structure of the muscular plexus and the nervous system.
684.6 Discussion
In a third approach, we apply PCA to head shapes of dierent atworm species as a tool
for taxonomic classication. We captured the main characteristics of head shapes of four
species belonging to dierent genera by just two shape modes. The result suggests that
head morphogenesis is mainly controlled by two molecular networks: one to determine
the head width and a second one for the anterior positioning of the auricles. The
availability of transcriptome sequence data for these species will now provide us with
the opportunity to test this hypothesis. We also have planned to extend the analysis
to many more species of the collection in the laboratory of Jochen Rink and relate
the characteristic body plan features to the conditions in the respective environmental
niche. A similar inter-species comparison with respect to evolutionary selected traits
has been performed for beaks of Darwin nches, phalanxes of vertebrates, heads of ants
and wings of bats (103, 199). Based on these analyses, we expect for atworms that a
small number of shape modes with the largest eigenvalues spans the feature space, in
which most of the shape variations take place. Highly specialized species have typically
rather extreme morphologies and can be found at the corners of the observed shape
set. In contrast, generalists show mixtures of dierent traits, which simultaneously
optimizes the tness to full several tasks. It will be interesting to test this hypothesis
for atworm species, some of which inhabit extreme environments.
695. Quantitative study of
atworm growth and cell turnover
5.1. Homeostasis is a dynamic steady state
Multicellular organisms in their adult stages have a relatively constant outward ap-
pearance but the integrity of a functional body is only maintained due to a permanent
replacement of damaged or lost cells (158). In humans, it has been estimated that the
total mass of cells we replace every year is almost as much as our entire body weight
(166). The time scales of the cellular turnover range from a few days for blood cells
and the stomach to several years for cells in the heart and the skeleton (124). Only a
small fraction of cells like some nerve cells might never be replaced.
From the point of view of dynamical systems theory, a constant outward appearance in
the face of permanent turnover can be considered as a steady state, for which inows
(i.e. the generation of new cells) and outows (i.e. the loss of old cells) are balanced.

stepping into rivers staying the same other and

500 BC (105)The underlying processes of cell division and cell
loss have to be well controlled in order to avoid a
disintegration of the organism or an uncontrolled
overgrowth such as cancer. For this to function
robustly, there is likely a communication between
the dying cells in the tissue and the dividing stem cells in their niche, see Fig. 5.1. A
limited capacity to replace cells is related to sickness and aging of organisms (158).
During growth, the balance between inows and outows is shifted to an increased cell
division in comparison to cell loss. Importantly, growth is not only controlled by a
developmental program but also inuenced by the availability of food (113, 244). In
many organisms, nutrition levels aect the speed of growth and the nal size.
In this chapter, we address the link between the microscopic scale of cell turnover and
the macroscopic growth in our favourite multicellular organism the atworm Smed .
Previous research has mainly been devoted to cell death and cell division as individual
processes but little is known about how these two processes are jointly regulated and
mutually inuence each other to result in coordinated growth at the organism scale

(158). Flatworms are suitable model organisms to study cell turnover and growth in
a comprehensive way as they permanently replace all of their cells within a few weeks
and reversibly grow over a 40-fold range in size (16, 140, 151, 158, 170). Thereby,
the cell size appears to be approximately constant and the reversible growth mainly
corresponds to a change in cell number (16, 140, 150, 193). Interestingly, changes in
worm size has been previously related to aging and small worms have been described
to be more juvenile. In Appendix E.1, we discuss signatures of aging in sexual and
asexual atworms.
Two basic models of growth and turnover control have been discussed for atworms:
(i) stem cell control and (ii) cell death control (159), see Fig. 5.2. In the rst scenario,
dividing stem cells or their descendants induce cell death in dierentiated cells for
replacement. In order to generate growth, the replacement must not be perfect. We
might hypothesize that cells only respond with a certain probability (maybe depending
on their age or tness) to the death signal from the stem cell pool. In the second
scenario, the dying cells send out signals to enhance cell division and recruit progenitor
cells to the tissue. In both cases, an additional input from the nutritional status of the
worm is needed for growth.
By studying atworms as a model system, we aim to bridge the scales between cellular
turnover processes and growth and degrowth on the organismal level. First, we quantify

the size of the worms as well as growth dynamics and nd a non-trivial size-dependence
of the growth and degrowth rates. All experiments were performed in the laboratory
of Jochen Rink. Several members have been involved in this close collaboration as we
will explicitly state for each data set. In a second step, we theoretically discuss three
paradigmatic models for how cell division and cell loss might be linked to the metabolic
status of the worm. Each model is able to explain the observed behavior within the
accuracy of the measurements. We obtain several predictions of the models that can be
tested in further experiments. The results directly relate to the questions of how these
worms can survive long starvation periods and what determines the limits to growth.
Finally, we establish the theoretical framework for future measurements to reveal the
control logic of turnover processes.
5.2. Size-dependent growth and degrowth dynamics in
atworms
5.2.1. Allometric scaling laws
5.2.1.1. Measurements of area, cell number and mass of the worm
The rst step towards measuring growth dynamics is to accurately determine worm size.
Together with our experimental collaborators we performed experiments to extract the
outer dimensions like length and width as well as the cell number and the mass of the
worms. From these measurements we obtained allometric scaling laws that relate the
various quantities for cross-validation and to gain further information about the body
plan of Smed , see Fig. 5.3.
One important quantity is the area of the worm, which refers to the 2D-projection
of the worm body. Area as well as other outer dimensions are readily accessible by
microscopic imaging and we have developed a protocol to measure these quantities in
725.2 Size-dependent growth and degrowth dynamics in atworms
a precise and reproducible way, see Appendix C. Several student helpers in the group
of Jochen Rink have been involved in the imaging of the worms. The author designed
the experiments, provided training and supervision and performed the analysis of the
data.
Fig. 5.3(a) reveals an allometric scaling relation between worm area and length with
an exponent of 1 :810:01. Thus, large worms are relatively thinner than small worms.
Remarkably, the scaling law holds across the entire size range with a very small trans-
verse spread and a high reproducibility. These worms were starved for at least a week.
The respective scaling law for well fed worms can be found in Appendix E.2. There we
also discuss the details of the data analysis. The scaling exponents have been deter-
mined using a robust regression algorithm with bi-squared weights implicitly obtained
from the spread of the data.
Ultimately, we are most interested in the changes in cell number because this quantity
directly relates to the rates of cell division and cell death. However, measurements of cell
numbers are fatal for the worms. As a solution, we establish a functional relationship
between cell number and worm area. By using the worm area as a read-out for size,
we can reduce the number of worms needed for various experiments and perform time-
course experiments with well-dened initial sizes.
The cell number itself has been measured in two dierent ways by Albert Thommen in
the group of Jochen Rink. First, he determined the amount of histones in the worm.
Histones are structural units that organize the DNA in eukaryotic cells (68). The DNA
strands are wrapped around the histones in the nuclei for compaction. Histones are
only synthesized during cell division and the amount of histones was measured to be
constant throughout the lifetime of the cells. After the amount of histones per cell has
been determined, the total amount of histones in a worm can be used as a read-out for
cell number. For this, the amount of histones was measured via Western blotting in a
known fraction of the total protein mass. In a second experiment, cell numbers were
obtained by disintegrating the worm into individual cells and automatically counting
cells in microscope images of a well dened volume fraction of the worm.
The resulting cell numbers are plotted in Fig. 5.3(b) as a function of worm size. We
nd that the number of cells scales almost linearly with the area of the worms with a
scaling exponent of 1 :110:02. The most simple explanation would be that the height
hardly changes and also the large worms remain rather at. Alternatively, the size of
cavities like the gut might increase over-proportionately, compensating for an potential
increase in height for larger worms. Furthermore, it might be possible that the fraction

745.2 Size-dependent growth and degrowth dynamics in atworms
of cell types changes, which might also explain a linear scaling despite variations in
height. Irrespective of which scenario applies, the scaling exponent shows that our area
measurements are a good proxy for cell number.
Finally, we also determine the dry mass of the worms. Again, the experiment has been
carried out by Albert Thommen, while the analysis of the movies has been performed
by the author. Although more data is needed for a more reliable result, the analysis of
the rst data points suggests that the scaling exponent of 1 :330:06 for the dry mass
is larger than the exponent for the cell number. Therefore, the mass per cell seems to
slightly increase with size. Interestingly, some preliminary measurements suggest that
in contrast the protein mass per cell is independent of worm size, see Appendix E.2.
5.2.1.2. Comparison and interpretation of scaling laws
Previously, contradictory results have been published on scaling laws in Smed and other
related species, see Tab. 5.1. For Planaria maculata , the scaling of worm mass with
area to the power of 1 :38 agrees well with our result (227). For Dugesia lugubris , Lange
measured the volume in serial sections and found a quadratic relationship with length,
which is in agreement with our scaling law for the cell number (110, 111). Bagu~ n a
et al. have measured cell number and worm volume in Smed (13, 16). In agreement
with our data, they nd similar values for the cell numbers and from them we can
obtain a quadratic scaling with the length of the worm. However, a few years later,
the same group published various scaling laws for four dierent species including sexual
and asexual atworms which do not agree with our results.
Further, more recent measurements of the worm mass by Oviedo et al. also deviate
from our scaling law (150). However, a scaling with L0:9is a rather questionable result
considering that the worm width also increases. In the same paper, the authors counted
the number of cintillo cells, which are found around the margin of the head and are
involved in mechanosensing. If we assume that the head can be approximated by a
semicircle and that the number of cintillo cells increases proportionately to the head
margin, the width of the worm at the head follows L0:68, see Appendix E.2, which
is similar to our results. For Schmidtea polychroa , the wet weight and the protein
content have been measured (133). At least the protein content might show a similar
dependence on area as in our experiment. Finally, Takeda et al. measured the total
DNA mass in Dugesia japonica and nd an approximately linear dependence on body
length (211). As the cell number can be assumed to be roughly proportional to the total
DNA mass, this is not in agreement with our measurements in Fig. 5.3(b). In analogy

to the argument about the worm mass of Oviedo et al. , such a linear relationship of
cell number with length is unlikely given the signicant increase in worm width in
larger worms. Note that the spectroscopic quantication of atworm DNA is rather
unreliable because it interferes with the absorption peak of the pigments. Hence, we
apply dierent approaches.
Thus, while we could conrm several measurements of scaling laws in atworms ob-
tained before 1980, we nd much less agreement with recently published results. This
discrepancy with respect to our data might only in parts be explained by species-
specic variations and dierences between sexual and asexual strains and could relate
to the general problem of size measurements in animals with exible body shapes. In
our experiments, we have paid particular attention to accuracy and reproducibility by
analyzing movie sequences of individual worms, following a strict protocol. Exten-
sive cross-checks as well as consistency-checks between redundant measurements were
performed.
Our results on the scaling of the cell number suggest that atworms indeed stay rather
at. As the worms lack a blood system, this would ensure that all cells can be provided
with oxygen by diusion from the outer epithelium. While this is the most likely
yet not the only explanation for the observed scaling relation in Fig. 5.3(b), further
measurements of worm heights are necessary to conrm our hypothesis. More data
points are also needed for the scaling relation of the dry mass. The data at hand
765.2 Size-dependent growth and degrowth dynamics in atworms
suggests that the characteristics of the cell population depend on size in the sense that
in larger worms there are more cells with an increased mass. Note, however, that a rst
approximate estimation of protein content in the worm does indicate that the protein
content per cell roughly stays constant, see Appendix E.2. Thus, a possible explanation
for the increase in cell mass could be the storage of lipids as energy resources in larger
worms.
Having established size measurements, next, we aim to analyze growth dynamics.
5.2.2. Characterizing the immediate growth response upon feeding
Worms respond to feeding with a fast mitotic peak within the rst 12 hours that lasts
for 3 5 days (12, 13, 16, 71, 139, 142). We would like to relate this mitotic feeding
response to the increase in worm size. Fig. 5.4(a) shows the changes in worm area
immediately after feeding. After an initial increase of the worm area, the worms shrink
again and return to their initial sizes within approximately two weeks.
Note that the worm area already approaches its maximum very rapidly within the
rst 12 hours after feeding, although the mitotic response lasts for following next days.
Thus, we were wondering which part of the peak can be explained by pure stung
of the gut and which part reects the actual cell division response. To this end, we
measured the growth response also for irradiated animals without stem cells, see red
curves in Fig. 5.4(b). Interestingly, the stung eect last for at least the rst 4 days
until the irradiated worms dissociate. Thus, the initial increase in worm area after
feeding actually reects stung.
Nevertheless, these measurements provide us with the following information: First,
the food lls the gut for at least 4 days, most likely providing the dividing cells with
nutrients during this time. Second, the growth response appears to be rather generic
and food intake is approximately proportional to worm size. We also have not found an
obvious dependence on feeding history. Growth peaks after longer starvation periods
look similar to the results above, see Appendix E.2. Finally, the growth eect decays
within two weeks. Thus, worms should approximately keep their size when being fed
every two weeks. After one week, the worm size has been roughly increased by 2%.
Further experiments will aim to extract changes in cell number upon feeding to reveal
the actual growth response.

785.2 Size-dependent growth and degrowth dynamics in atworms
5.2.3. Small worms grow and degrow faster than large worms
5.2.3.1. Measurement of growth rates
Even though we have learned that stung eects compromise tracking of the short
term growth pulse, we can still quantify the averaged growth behavior on the time
scale of weeks and in particular analyze how the growth and degrowth rates depend
on feeding. Fig. 5.5(a)-(c) shows the growth tracks for individual worms of dierent
sizes for three feeding conditions: starvation, feeding every second week and feeding
every week. In agreement with Fig. 5.4, the worms that are fed every second week
approximately maintain a constant size. One can clearly recognize the growth response
upon feeding that decays until the next feeding event. The concatenation of short-term
growth pulses results in a zig-zag line. For the other two cases, we compute average
growth rates, see Fig. 5.5(d). The data is very noisy for the well-fed worms because
of the stung eect and the excretion of digested food. Still, we can obtain a clear
linear trend using two independent tting procedures. Besides the robust regression of
the growth rates (black, with 95% condence intervals), we construct a master curve
from the growth tracks assuming negligible eects of the feeding history, see Fig. 5.5(e).
The growth tracks of Fig. 5.5(c) are shifted horizontally in an iterative procedure to
minimize the variance from the average curve. Finally, we t a Fermi function as the
master curve, which corresponds to a growth rate that linearly depends on size. Both
approaches agree well with each other.
Fig. 5.5(d) shows a clear size-dependence of the growth and degrowth rates. Small
worms appear to grow faster than large worms. Note that even the largest worms have
a positive growth rate, meaning worms usually undergo ssioning before reaching the
limits to growth. Surprisingly, small worms also degrow faster. This trend appears to
be rather independent from the feeding history, see Fig. 5.5(f).
5.2.3.2. Discussion of growth and degrowth dynamics
As for the allometric scaling laws, our results on the growth dynamics rather agree with
very early measurements and less so with more recent publications.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Abeloos investigated growth dynamics in another
atworm species (1). In analogy to our conclusion, he found that the increase in dry
mass is stronger for smaller species.
Bagu~ n a et al. have analyzed growth and degrowth dynamics of Girardia tigrina for
various feeding conditions (15, 18). We can extract from these data sets that their
growth rates are also decreasing with size during feeding, see Appendix E.2. The

with log-linear plot illustrates the deviation from an exponential law. (f) Magnication
of the degrowth rates for time intervals after the initial feeding shows no obvious
dependence on feeding history. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.
growth rates are smaller than in our case, which could be a species-specic eect or
due to gut stung. Furthermore, it might also be related to the lower temperature of
12C, while our experiments are conducted at 20C. More importantly, the degrowth
rates during starvation seem not to depend on the sizes of the worms in contrast to our
data.
Other groups have also measured growth dynamics and typically tted exponential
functions with constant growth rates (34, 71, 215). Gonz alez-Est evez et al. pooled
all worms together and therefore their data cannot discriminate between constant and
weakly size-dependent rates (71). Nevertheless, the value of 1 :8 %/day for the degrowth
rate agrees well with our results in the considered size range of 1  5 mm2. Thomas
et al. tracked the growth of individual worms but did not explicitly analyze a size-
dependence of the rates (215). They obtain values below 5 %/day and most of them
lie in the range of 2  3 %/day, which is in good agreement with our data.
Oviedo et al. even claim to nd linear functions for growth and degrowth with size
(150). In consequence, the absolute values for growth and degrowth rates become
smaller in larger worms like in Fig. 5.5(d). Yet, otherwise the result does only roughly
agree with our data, mainly for the case of starvation, see Appendix E.2. Although
they even feed twice a week, they obtain very low growth rates, which are even lower
than their degrowth rates.
Finally, it has previously been claimed that nutritional status and not size determines
the growth dynamics (71). Yet, the respective measurements might not be able to
resolve this issue because it does not compare size matched worms of dierent feeding
histories. In fact, our data with a controlled feeding history supports the opposite
hypothesis.

values.
In summary, our measurements of growth dynamics agree in some cases quantitatively
and in others qualitatively with studies published by other groups but also go signi-
cantly beyond. In particular, we were able to reveal the size dependence of the growth
rates by establishing a strict protocol of feeding and imaging and a highly accurate
image analysis. Furthermore, we were tracking individual worms and our measure-
ments span the full range in size in contrast to the previous works discussed.
Our analysis clearly shows that small worms show faster growth and degrowth dynamics
than large worms. Fig. 5.6 illustrates why this is a non-trivial observation. Naively one
could have assumed that there is one limiting quantity that makes the use of food less
ecient in larger worms, resulting in a decreasing growth rate with size, see Fig. 5.6(a).
Dierent amounts of food would result in a shift of the curve. In consequence, worms
would approach a steady state size, depending on the feeding frequency (crosses). In
contrast, the trends of the curves for Smed change between feeding and starvation
and the worms either grow or degrow. Fig. 5.6(b) shows our result in terms of cell
numbers. It suggests that there might be two dierent eects that depend in opposite
ways on the size of the worm and each of which dominates for either starvation or
maximum feeding. Stung eects as discussed in Sec. 5.2.2 might introduce correction
factors to the obtained growth rates. However, we expect no change in the qualitative
trends. In the next section, we explore three theoretical models that can account for
the size-dependence of the growth rates.
825.3 Theoretical descriptions of cell turnover dynamics and energy ux
5.3. Theoretical descriptions of cell turnover dynamics and
energy ux
Fig. 5.6(b) shows nontrivial growth dynamics in atworms depending on feeding con-
ditions. Growth corresponding to a change in cell number can be described by the two
processes of cell division and cell loss with eective rates kdivandkloss, respectively:
_N=kdivN klossN: (5.1)
With this, the growth rates plotted in Fig. 5.5(d) are given by
_N=N =kdiv kloss: (5.2)
Thus,K=kdiv klosshas to depend on Nsuch that it decreases with Nfor feeding
and increases with Nfor starvation.
One possible scenario to explain this behavior is a change in the fraction of stem cells. In
fact, it has been reported that the neoblast fraction in Dugesia lugubris (110, 111) and
Dugesia tigrina (13, 16, 18) decreases as the worm grows. A higher stem cell fraction
in smaller worms would lead to a larger growth rate during feeding. Additionally, it
might be associated with a higher basal cell turnover, yielding a faster degrowth rate
in the absence of food. However, the dierence in the neoblast fraction was estimated
to be less than 10%, which can not account by far for the observed size dependence
of the growth rates. Thus, it is rather unlikely that the fraction of neoblasts in Smed
varies by a factor of 2 or 3 like the growth rates. In fact, preliminary experimental data
obtained by the group of Jochen Rink suggests that the stem cell fraction stays rather
constant in animals of dierent sizes.
Feeding has a major eect on the growth dynamics. Therefore, we propose to consider
the metabolic energy Etin the worm as a limiting factor that inuences cell proliferation
and cell death. At this point, we need to properly dene this quantity, even though
the conclusion will be largely independent of the exact denition. For the rest of the
chapter,Etrefers to the total amount of ATP and the ATP equivalent of any other
molecule storing metabolic energy like glucose and lipids, whether it is found inside
or outside the cells. Analogous descriptions can be found if only the freely available
energy outside the cells is considered or if one takes into account the abundance of
other limiting molecules like amino acids that need to be taken up by the food and that
are necessary for the worm to stay healthy and alive.
835. QUANTIFYING FLATWORM GROWTH AND CELL TURNOVER
In a minimal model, the total energy Etincreases due to net inux Jfby feeding and
decreases due to consumption by metabolic housekeeping with rate :
@tEt=Jf N: (5.3)
A typical value for the metabolic consumption per cell would be of the order of 10 pW
as estimated for Schmidtea polychroa (133). In humans with 4 1013cells and an energy
consumption of 107J/day (124), we estimate 1 pW. Further values obtained for
228 mammalian species from shrimp to elephant also show a decrease with size across
the range of 1 10 pW (240).
Eq. 5.3 assumes for simplicity that the energy stored in the dying cells can be completely
taken up by the remaining cells. We could consider an additional term of the form
 lossecklossN, accounting for imperfect recycling upon cell death. Here, ecdenotes
the metabolic energy per cell and lossis the fraction of it that is lost per dying cell.
The main conclusions of this chapter remain unchanged even for loss>0.
We dene the metabolic energy per cell as ec=Et=Nand nd for its dynamics
@tec=jf  Kec: (5.4)
Here,jf=Jf=Nis the net inux per cell and the last term describes a dilution eect.
As the worm grows, the same amount of energy has to be shared among a larger number
of cells.
In the following, we discuss three basic models on how the metabolic energy per cell
might eect cell division and loss. Given the simplicity of the models, they all t
the noisy data reasonably well. Yet, they result in very dierent predictions about
the respective variables and parameters such as metabolic consumption and storage of
energy, which will be tested in future experiments.
The models describe three distinct scenarios of energy storage: (i) dynamic energy
storage, for which feeding increases the fraction of energy stored in the worm, (ii)
energy storage of xed proportion, for which the worm is not able to store additional
amount of energy upon feeding, and (iii) size-dependent energy storage, for which the
fraction of energy stored depends on the size of the worm and not explicitly on feeding.
In the rst model, the metabolic energy per cell ecchanges as a direct read-out of size
and feeding conditions and directly regulates cell division and cell loss. In the second
and third model, the metabolic energy is quickly regulated to a physiologically preferred
target value e0by adjusting the cell turnover rates. Thereby, the mechanism implicitly
draws on the idea of integral feedback control, which is commonly used in engineering
applications to drive a dynamic variable to a pre-set value.
845.3 Theoretical descriptions of cell turnover dynamics and energy ux
5.3.1. Model 1: Dynamic energy storage
In a most simple model for metabolic growth control, the cells are assumed to directly
respond to the amount of metabolic energy per cell ec. If there is an excess in energy,
cells divide more often, and if there is a lack of energy, the death rate increases. Let us
consider a simple case, for which the growth rate depends linearly on ec:
K=K0(ec=es 1) (5.5)
with the constant parameters K0andes, which determine the rate of growth and the
energy, for which the worm switches between growth and degrowth, respectively.
The change in energy _ ecas a function of ecis plotted in Fig. 5.7(a). During starvation
periods, when jf= 0, the growth rate is decreasing, which requires _ ec<0 (red curve).
The maximum of _ ecis atec=es=2 and from _ ec<0 follows that >esK0=4.
During feeding with jf>, the curve in Fig. 5.7(a) is shifted upwards and ecends up
in a regime, for which the organism grows (blue). If jfwas constant, there would be
a stable steady state with e
c=es=2 +p
(es=2)2+ (jf )es=K0. We see that e
c>es
forjf>  and the system is in the growing regime. In order for the growth rate to
decrease with worm size as seen in Fig. 5.6(b), the inux due to feeding jf(N) must
not be constant but has to be a decreasing function of N.
Fig. 5.7(b) illustrates a time course of N, when going through several rounds of feeding
and starvation, always switching at a certain size (horizontal lines). Especially in the
beginning of the starvation interval, we see an overshoot, for which the worm still
grows although the feeding has stopped. Nevertheless, we want to stress that the
growth and degrowth behavior is rather generic. The growth and degrowth rates in
Fig. 5.7(c) collapse and show the same size-dependence, irrespectively of the initial
values for energy and cell number. Any perturbation decays quickly and there is no
strong dependence on feeding history.
We can t this model to the experimental data, see Fig. 5.8(a). The plots shows the
size dependence of the inux jfand illustrate that the metabolic energy per cell ecacts
as a read-out for both feeding conditions and size at the same time.

865.3 Theoretical descriptions of cell turnover dynamics and energy ux
5.3.2. Model 2: Fixed proportion energy storage
We now assume that the energy per cell ecis quickly regulated to a physiologically
preferred target value e0. In this scenario, there might still be specialized energy stores
like fat cells but they are only formed proportionally to the worm size and not in
response to feeding. Any metabolic energy outside the cells is also quickly regulated,
which is typical for the metabolism of animals. For example, sugar levels in the human
blood are under tight regulation by the insulin pathway and insulin-like molecules
are found even in the simplest unicellular eukaryotes (114). Yet again in contrast to
humans, here we assumed that no additional long-term storage cells are formed upon
feeding. Instead, the metabolic energy is regulated by adjustment of cell division and
cell death. We can picture an integral feedback scheme, according to which Kchanges
depending on the dierence between ecande0:
K_K=K0(ec=e0 1) (5.6)
This control theoretic approach substantially diers from the case of model 1 in Eq. 5.5.
Given a fast regulation to the target value e0(K!0),Krelaxes to
K=jf 
e0; (5.7)
which denes the nullcline of _ ec= 0 according to Eq. 5.4.
Fig. 5.6(b) shows that the degrowth rate is decreasing during starvation, where jf= 0.
Thus,has to increase for smaller worms. Fig. 5.8(b) illustrates the size-dependence of
based on our measurements. This can be interpreted in the sense that the metabolism
is less ecient in smaller animals, which is in agreement with the typical metabolic sca-
ling laws found across the animal kingdom (7, 190) and which have also been observed
in atworms (71, 92, 133).
During feeding the growth rate decreases with size. Thus, jfhas to decrease with N
and even has to overcompensate for the opposite eect of . This suggests that food
uptake is less ecient in larger animals, see Fig. 5.8(b).
Taken together, we assumed that the metabolic energy is the limiting factor determined
by the corresponding nutrition inux and consumption, to which turnover rates are
adjusted accordingly. We obtained two functions, one for and one for jf, which
depend on worm size in opposite ways and therefore can account for the opposite
trends in the growth and degrowth dynamics.
As a side note, one might question what is cause and what is consequence. While
it is likely that the metabolic energy is the limiting factor during starvation periods,

Figure 5.8.: (a) Model 1 is characterized by energy stores that are lled and depleted
depending on feeding and worm size. The stored energy per cell ecas well as the
metabolic rate and the feeding inux jfare obtained by minimizing the variance
between the experimental data and numerical solutions of our model. The values
are given relative to the energy es, for which the worm switches between growth and
degrowth. (b) Model 2 draws on energy stores with xed proportions. We compute 
andjfrelative to the energy per cell from the ts to the growth and degrowth rates
in Fig. 5.5(d). The energy per cell ec=e0is assumed to be constant. (c) In model 3
with size-dependent energy stores, the energy per cell ecchanges in a size-dependent
manner, while =0andjfare constant. Degrowth and growth rates are tted by
the same function with a dierent amplitude corresponding to the feeding inux. (d)
Basic scheme of model 3: During feeding, small worms invest their metabolic energy
in growth, yet large worms store an increasing fraction of the available energy. During
starvation, large worms degrow more slowly as they can deplete their energy stores.
885.3 Theoretical descriptions of cell turnover dynamics and energy ux
this is not necessarily the case for maximum feeding. In the presence of an abundance
of food in the gut, cell division response could rather be limited by other factors as
the maximum rate of DNA replication and the available number of stem cells. This
would invert the argument: there would be a generic, yet size-dependent response of
cell division (and maybe cell death) and the size dependence of the net inux jfis
merely a consequence of it.
5.3.3. Model 3: Size-dependent energy storage
In the scenario above, we introduced a constant target value e0for the metabolic energy
that determined the turnover rates. In our third and nal model, we again consider
a quick relaxation to such a target energy, but now this energy e0(N) changes with
worm size. For example, the fraction of energy-rich cells could increase in large worms.
We again obtain Eq. 5.7 but now andjfare assumed to be constant for simplicity,
whilee0depends on N. The three variables are plotted in Fig. 5.8(b). Even with only
one size-dependent quantity, we obtain a reasonable t to the data. If additionally
was allowed to change as suggested by the measurements of metabolic scaling laws
(7, 92, 133, 190), the ts would even improve.
The basic logic of such a mechanism based on energy storage cells is shown in Fig. 5.8(d).
While small worms invest all available energy into growth, large worms store part of
their energy uptake and thus grow more slowly. In consequence, large worms deplete
these energy stores during starvation and initially degrow more slowly. Importantly,
we assume that the size of the stores scales with worm size. Thus, only an eective
size-dependence of growth and degrowth is observed, but no explicit dependence on
feeding history.
5.3.4. Discussion of the turnover models
We have explored three models that are based on very dierent assumptions and dif-
fer greatly in the microscopic details, yet they all can account for the observed size-
dependent growth behavior. This is an interesting observation, which one should gen-
erally take into consideration when comparing microscopic models to more macroscopic
data. A theoretical model is typically associated with a specic coarse-graining level.
As a necessary condition, it needs to agree with observations on larger scales, but this
is not sucient for the model to be unique. In order to distinguish between several
microscopic models, one usually needs measurements on the same level.
895. QUANTIFYING FLATWORM GROWTH AND CELL TURNOVER
In our case, the theory makes specic testable predictions about the inux, consump-
tion and storage of energy, as illustrated in Fig 5.8. In close collaboration with our
experimental colleagues, we have planned further experiments to measure these quan-
tities and to parametrize the models. First, it needs to be veried that the fraction of
stem cells is approximately constant in Smed and cannot explain the growth dynamics.
Furthermore, our collaborators are conducting experiments at the time of writing to
determine metabolic rates and feeding inux. Additionally, they aim to identify po-
tential stores for the metabolic energy and probe the eects of inhibiting them. The
existence of fat cells has already been reported for other atworm species (93).
Fig. 5.4 already shows that the stung peak is approximately proportional to worm size.
If therefore the average amount of food that becomes available per cell is independent
of the size of the worm, it will support the third model. Furthermore, we have discussed
in Section 5.2.1 that the scaling laws for worm mass and total protein mass might also
be in agreement with an increased storage of lipids or glycogen in larger worms. It
remains to be answered whether the scaling of metabolic rates and storage cells can
explain the growth and degrowth behavior in Smed .
Even though the models are highly simplied and gut stung might introduce cor-
rections, we can extract order of magnitude estimates from the ts to the data. For
example, we can estimate from all three models that each cell stores on average as much
energy as needed to maintain it for approximately ec== 50 to 150 days. In compari-
son, the metabolic rate in humans is 1 pW and the total energy stored in human fat
cells (as the main energy storage) is 4 108J (124). Thus, ec= 10 5J, which amounts
to a similar ratio of ec== 130 days. Furthermore, based on measurements in the at-
worm Schmidtea polychroa and on the typical metabolic scaling laws (124, 133, 240),
we expect the metabolic rate of Smed to be in the range of 10 pW per cell. Thus,
according to our models, each cell stores as much as ec10 5to 10 4J. Note that
this estimate is based on the assumption of perfect recycling of the energy upon cell
death. For imperfect recycling, the value is reduced.
Metabolic energy can be stored in various ways: in lipids or glycogen, in specialized fat
cells or distributed among many dierent cell types. An interesting observation in this
respect is the presence of germ line precursor cells in asexual atworms. Cells without
a purpose should vanish during evolution. Thus, we might speculate that the germ
line precursors in asexual worms might have an additional function for the metabolic
housekeeping. In analogy to the third model, they are especially prominent in large
worms and can potentially serve as energy stores during starvation.
905.4 Control logic for cell turnover and growth
5.4. Control logic for cell turnover and growth
5.4.1. Measuring cell turnover on various scales
So far, we have investigated how the cellular behavior might depend on feeding condi-
tions and worm size but we have not explicitly distinguished between the adjustment of
cell division on the one hand and cell loss or death on the other hand. In this section,
we now discuss how these individual processes might be controlled. In order to unravel
the control logic, we propose experiments on various scales, ranging from the level of
individual cells to a whole tissue and to the averaged turnover dynamics across the
entire worm. The main questions are:
Does feeding and worm size aect rather cell proliferation or cell death?
How do both processes inuence each other?
To what extent does aging play a role on the cellular scale?
The rst question will be addressed mainly at the cellular level and the second and
third question at the tissue level.
Turnover dynamics at the cellular level. | Previous measurements indicate that there
is an catabolic default state during starvation periods, in which cell loss dominates over
cell division. Upon feeding, there are short-term mitotic bursts leading to growth, as
sketched in Fig. 5.9 (12, 13, 16, 71, 101, 139, 142, 170). However, it is not clear whether
the cell loss rate also changes as part of the feeding response and to what extent division
and loss depends on feeding history. It has been suggested that apoptosis rates might in
fact increase after the atworms have been fed, especially after long starvation periods,
as a means of cell renewal (71, 159).
Assessing these questions is complicated by the fact that cell loss is poorly dened.
Apart from the classical apoptosis pathway many other processes might contribute to
cell loss such as other mechanisms of programmed cell death but also uncontrolled
shedding of epidermis cells. In contrast, cell division can be well characterized. In
Appendix E.3 we discuss a measurement scheme to extract division rates. By comparing
cell division to worm growth, we will also be able to determine to what extent cell death
rates are regulated.
Turnover dynamics at the tissue level. | By monitoring the turnover dynamics in
epidermis cells, we can exemplify how cell addition and removal work together to result

in a well controlled size regulation. In the next section, we introduce a respective
measurement protocol. We show preliminary data, which suggests that cell death
depends on the age of the cells.
We also discuss further experiments to conrm the eect of aging and to investigate
how the individual turnover processes inuence each other. On the one hand, turnover
could be a rather stochastic process, in which cells are inserted in the tissue and deleted
independently, yet on average at balanced rates. On the other hand, insertion and
deletion could be tightly linked such that a cell is preferentially removed in the presence
of a new cell that replaces it. We suggest a double labeling experiment which can
potentially distinguish the two control paradigms.
Turnover dynamics at the organismal level. | After constructing a comprehensive
model on how turnover and growth is regulated based on the experiments on the cellular
and the tissue scale, we can validate the model by measurements across the entire
worm. To this end, we adapt a protocol that has originally been developed to analyze
cell turnover in human brain cells (203). In Appendix E.4, we provide the theoretical
framework to set up the experiment.
5.4.2. Analyzing turnover of the epidermis as an example tissue
Epidermis cells as the outermost skin cells can be non-invasively labeled by soaking
the worms in CFSE solution (carboxyuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester). It has
been observed that the labeled cells disappear within days as a result of turnover of
the epithelial tissue. From this experiments, we can estimate turnover rates of the
925.4 Control logic for cell turnover and growth
tissue and investigate whether older cells are more prone to die. We will also propose
a protocol with two consecutive labeling pulses, which might enable us to understand
how insertion and deletion of cells is coordinated.
5.4.2.1. Measuring turnover rates by single pulse labeling
Cell turnover processes. | We describe turnover in a cell population by three dierent
processes: (i) deletion of cells, (ii) insertion of cells and (iii) replacement of cells (i.e.
coupled insertion and deletion), see Fig. 5.10(a). Note that deletion potentially includes
many dierent processes: the induced removal by long range signals or quorum sensing
in the tissue, cell-autonomous decisions as well as uncontrolled shedding.
In order to measure turnover dynamics, we labeled all cells in the epidermis by soaking
in CFSE and counted the fraction of labeled cells in the eld of view after time t, see
Fig. 5.10(b)-(c). The experiments were performed by Sarah Mansour in the group of
Jochen Rink. The author analyzed the data by automatically counting the cells with a
custom MATLAB code.
Dynamics of a labeled cell population. | Let us consider the number density n(a) of
cells of a certain age a. The total number of cells Nin the tissue and the number of
labeled cells N`are given by
N=Z1
0n(a)da ; N `=Z1
tn(a)da: (5.8)
Due to cell turnover, these quantities change in time as follows
_N= (ki kd)N (5.9)
_N`= (kd`+kr`)N`: (5.10)
Here, we consider the rate for cell insertion kiand average rates for the replacement of
labeled cells kr`as well as for the deletion of labeled and unlabeled cells kd`andkd:
kr`=Z1

When taking snapshots of only part of the tissue, we do not obtain absolute numbers
but the fraction of labeled cells in the eld of view  `=N`=N, which obeys
_`=  kr`+ki+ (kd` kd)
`: (5.12)
The fraction of labeled cells might not only decrease due to replacement (rst term),
but also due to a dilution eect as unlabeled cells get inserted into the tissue (sec-
ond term). Furthermore, the third term arises if labeled cells and unlabeled cells are

ForT= 1 day, the turnover in irradiated worms (green) compares to non-irradiated
worms (black). Yet, for T= 5 days after irradiation, the labeled epidermis cells do
not vanish from the tissue anymore (red). All measurements were performed by Sarah
Mansour in the group of Jochen Rink. The author analyzed the data and tted the
models.
945.4 Control logic for cell turnover and growth
deleted at dierent rates (e.g. in an age-dependent manner). In contrast, if cells are
deleted stochastically (e.g. according to a Poisson process), kd(a) is constant and the
corresponding term vanishes: kd` kd= 0.
Feeding conditions and the sizes of the worms are approximately constant during the
course of the experiment. Thus, if the turnover does not depend on the age of the cells
(i.e.kdandkrare constant), we can expect an exponential solution  `= `;0e tktisto
Eq. 5.12 with a constant rate ktis=kr+ki. Yet, the preliminary data in Fig. 5.10(d)
does not strongly support an exponential law (dashed blue).
Another limiting case is that cells have a xed live span and only die at age amx. Thus,
the rates of deletion and replacement are kd(a) =(a amx) andkr(a) =(a amx).
Note that the worms only grow and degrow by a few percent per day, such that we can
assume that the tissue size only changes very little in comparison to the turnover time
scales of a few days. In consequence, the age distribution n(a) will be approximately
homogeneous and the solution to Eq. 5.12 a linear function  `= `;0 t=amx. This
simple linear model (solid red) appears to agree better with the data in Fig. 5.10(d).
In fact, the truth might be in between the two limiting cases. This would resonate with
an age-dependent turnover of the cells in the tissue such that old cells are more prone
to deletion or replacement.
The time dependence enters because the age distribution of labeled cells is shifted over
time. In order to extract in what way the cellular age inuences deletion or replacement
and which of the two processes is mostly aected, we need more sophisticated experi-
ments as discussed below. Also note that the presented data is only very preliminary
and has to be conrmed by further measurements.
Labeled cell fraction in irradiated worms. | We briey comment on a second pilot
experiment by Sarah Mansour, see Fig. 5.10 (e)-(f). Here, the measurement started
at varying times Tafter the worms were depleted of all stem cells by -irradiation.
First, we observe that tissue turnover is not directly aected by the loss of stem cells:
for smallTthe label fraction (green) decreases in the same way as for non-irradiated
worms (black). Labeled cells are replaced by progenitor cells, which were not deleted by
irradiation. Thus, there seems not to be a long-range signaling eect from the stem cell
pool. In contrast, T= 5 days after irradiation (red), the fraction of labeled cells does
not decrease anymore. In conclusion, dividing cells (which are aected by irradiation)
or corresponding signals need 5 days to reach the epidermal tissue.
955. QUANTIFYING FLATWORM GROWTH AND CELL TURNOVER
5.4.2.2. Monitoring cell turnover by double pulse labeling
We propose a double-labeling experiment using a second labeling pulse of a dierent
marker (DDAO-SE) applied after a short time interval  t, see Fig. 5.11(a). As a result,
there are two labeled cell populations { cells with both labels N2and young cells with
only the second label N1:
N1=Zt+t
tn(a)da ; N 2=Z1
t+tn(a)da: (5.13)
Similar to Eq. 5.12, the ratio  12=N1=N2obeys
_12=  
(kd1 kd2) + (kr1 kr2)
12; (5.14)
which includes the deletion and replacement rates of both labeled cell populations.
Additionally, we propose an irradiation experiment as depicted in Fig. 5.11(b). For this,
we choose the time interval Tsuch that there are still new cells arriving in the epidermis
during tbut not so after the second labeling pulse. According to our measurements
with a single label in Fig. 5.10(f), T+ t5. In consequence, ( kr1 kr2) = 0 during
the time interval t:
_12;irr= (kd1 kd2) 12: (5.15)
This shows that  12;irronly changes for age-dependent deletion rates. Thus, by com-
paring the dynamics of  12in non-irradiated and  12;irrin irradiated worms given by
Eq. 5.14 and 5.15, respectively, we can deduce whether deletion or replacement depends
on the age of the cell, as illustrated in Fig. 5.11(c). If  12;irrchanges according to a
time-dependent rate, deletion is related to the age of the cells. If instead only the
dynamics of  12are determined by a time-dependent rate, replacement relies on the
age of the cells.
Furthermore, we can extract actual rates for the individual processes by comparing the
results to the previous experiments. For example, kd2+kr2in Eq. 5.14 is equivalent to
kr`+kd`of the experiment with a single label. By combining these measurements, we
can nd the functional relationship for how deletion and replacement changes with the
age of the cells.
The same experiments can be performed in starving and well fed animals to reveal
the connection between feeding status and turnover rates. One hypothesis would be
that there is no insertion during starvation, yet replacement dominates and the tissue
slowly shrinks due to a small deletion rate. After feeding, insertion leads to growth of
the tissue.

5.5. Summary
Our aim is to study cell turnover and growth in a comprehensive way, bridging the
scales from a single cell to the average behavior at the level of the organism. For this,
we have carefully designed several experiments to determine the atworm size and to
characterize its growth dynamics. In particular, we developed a protocol for precise
measurement of the worm area based on the analysis of movie sequences with a custom
MATLAB routine. The data was compared to previous studies, which in parts yielded
controversial results.
We observed that the growth and degrowth rates are dependent on worm size. Smaller
worms grow and shrink faster. This resonates with the picture that small worms might
be more juvenile with a potentially higher turnover rate and a dierent metabolism
(71, 111). Based on the idea that the available metabolic energy is the main deter-
minant for growth, we have developed three distinct classes of microscopic models,
which can all be tted to the macroscopic growth data. The models describe different
paradigms of energy storage and make specic predictions that are tested by our col-
laborators in current experiments. In particular, they also dier in the way energy
inow (i.e. digestion of food) and energy outow (i.e. metabolic consumption) varies
with size, which directly relates to the question about the limits to growth.
Finally, we propose further experiments, which can unravel the control logic of cell and
tissue turnover. We provide the theoretical framework and discuss rst preliminary
data suggesting an age-dependent death of cells. The experiments will be performed in
the laboratory of Jochen Rink by the author and other members of the group.
976. Summary and outlook
In this thesis, we analyzed various aspects of growth and body plan scaling, drawing
particular inspiration from the atworm Schmidtea mediterranea (Smed ) as a model
animal. For this purpose, we combined theoretical descriptions and analysis of experi-
mental data.
As a rst approach, we analyzed previously proposed mechanisms for self-organized
pattern formation as well as pattern scaling in Chapter 2. We systematically extracted
the requirements for scaling and demonstrated that they are challenged by the fas-
cinating regeneration and re-patterning capabilities of atworms. On this basis, we
presented a minimal model for fully self-organized and self-scaling pattern formation
in Chapter 3. This mechanism is capable of spontaneously generating concentration
gradients and expression regions of involved molecules that robustly adjust to the size
of the system.
In the future, it will be interesting to further compare the theoretical framework and
the derived predictions to the Wnt/ -catenin system, which is associated with head-tail
(AP) polarity in Smed (4, 9, 81, 82). Preliminary measurements by our collaborators
indicate that the -catenin gradient as well as expression proles of various Wnts in
fact scale with worm size. Our theory enables us to interpret the data and to suggest
additional experiments to unravel the mechanism of scaling in atworms. Further
beyond, the results might also enrich the discussions on signaling gradients in other
systems, such as the developing y wing, for which it is still a matter of debate how
scaling is established (11, 26, 55, 233).
Smed only recently evolved to become a model organism, thus the basic mechanisms for
axis specication are far from being well understood (117). It is known that components
of the Wnt/ -catenin system are especially present in the tail (4, 9, 81, 82). However,
there could be also an additional patterning system originating from the head or even
a compartmentalization by several systems along the body axis. If there are several
anterior-posterior (AP) polarity systems, how do they interact? And to what extent is
the patterning self-organized or relies on pre-existing cues such as a polarized tissue or
wound-specic signals after amputation? We are currently analyzing a large data set
98comprising the spatial changes in gene expression after RNAi treatment and expression
time courses during regeneration in order to answer these questions.
Perpendicular to the AP axis, there are also two more body axes in dorsal-ventral and
medial-lateral direction (117). How do the patterning systems for the dierent body
axis inuence each other? Is there a hierarchy of axis formation or do the axes emerge
simultaneously? One particular curious case is the formation of a straight midline
as an important signaling center. The experimental data suggests that a repulsive
signal from the body margin positions the midline (3, 117, 121). Yet, is it sucient to
account for this narrow, straight row of distinct cells, which tends to re-emerge from
the anterior and posterior poles during regeneration? As a complementary approach,
we have started to design a model explaining midline formation on the basis of cell
proliferation and resulting cellular ows in the tissue.
Besides these long-range patterning mechanisms that are classically assumed to rely on
secreted, motile molecules, there are also other polarity cues. For example, the planar-
cell-polarity (PCP) system is based on direct cell-cell interactions and results in cellular
polarisation consistently across the tissue. In order to determine the coupling between
both mechanisms, we have started analyzing the motility of atworms, when various
Wnt-pathway components have been knocked out by RNAi feeding, see Chapter 4.
Resulting movement phenotypes report on a dysfunctional cilia carpet associated with
an impaired PCP system.
For a further, more detailed investigation of worm motility, we adapted principal com-
ponent analysis to apply it to the highly deformable worm body. We could demonstrate
that during normal gliding motion worms steer their path by bending in the preferred
direction of movement. Additionally, we provided the rst quantitative account of an
alternative motility mode, called inchworming. This appears to be a tightly controlled
behavioral response to impaired cilia functionality with a characteristic frequency of
about 1=4 Hz. Such stereotypic behaviors have been previously described in the much
simpler nematode C. elegans (207, 208, 209). It is a fascinating observation that more
complex organisms such as atworms still show very generic motility patterns, which
might have emerged during evolution as an optimized strategy and are expected to
relate to the structure of the muscular plexus and the nervous system. Similarly, we
were able to demonstrate the applicability of shape mode analysis to the variable head
shapes between dierent species. We are planning to extend this analysis to many more
species of the large atworm collection in the laboratory of Jochen Rink. As both, spe-
cic morphologies and specic movement strategies, are expected to emerge due to the
996. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
evolutionary pressure in the respective environmental niche, our analysis provides the
basis for future research relating form and function.
In the last chapter, we quantied growth and turnover dynamics in atworms. Interes-
tingly, we obtained size-dependent growth rates. Small worms appear to grow and
degrow faster than large worms. This particular growth and degrowth behavior of the
worms is the coarse-grained result from the underlying processes of cell division and
cell loss. Thus, we devised several microscopic models describing specic rules on the
cellular scale to explain the observed growth dynamics on the macroscopic level of the
organism. The models are based on the idea that there is a limiting quantity that
“Nothing in biology makes sense except in the
light of evolution.” — ditto, Theodosius
Dobzhansky, 1973 (41)(i) is provided by feeding, (ii) is permanently con-
sumed by the cells and (iii) aects the division
and loss rates of cells. As an example, we expli-
citly consider the metabolic energy as the limiting
quantity. All of our three models t the growth data equally well. Importantly, each
model is based on distinct assumptions on how the energy is stored and how the energy
availability aects the division and loss rates. Furthermore, each model makes specic
predictions about how the three considered processes of energy inux by feeding, energy
storage and energy consumption have to depend on the size of the worm to account for
the measured growth data.
With this result in mind, we contribute to the design of future experiments that will
enable us to distinguish between the models. Thereby, we aim to bridge scales by
providing an explanation for the organismal growth dynamics on the macroscopic level
in terms of cellular behavior on the microscopic scale. The outcome might also hint at
systemic limitations to growth. For example, if the food uptake is size-dependent and
relatively decreases with worm size, there will be an upper limit at which the worm
is not capable to sustain growth anymore. It then poses the question whether this
is a physical limit set by constraints of the worm body or whether evolution has not
selected for a more ecient uptake because worms anyways do not grow bigger for
other reasons. Similarly, energy stores that depend on either size or feeding will trigger
further investigations on the specic cells that store the energy. Are there specialized
fat cells or does a broad range of cells store the energy? An interesting idea is related
to the formation of the germ line. For sexual atworms, there might be a tradeo
between growth and the development of a reproductive system. Small worms would
rather grow to survive, large worms would rather invest in reproduction. Yet, germ
line precursor cells still exist in the asexual strain used in the experiments. From an
100evolutionary viewpoint, this might hint at a dual role of these cells, suggesting that
they are involved in growth control or energy storage.
The level of detail in the theory reected the coarse-graining level of the experimental
data. In a next step, we aim to go beyond and include further measurements to dissect
the control logic of growth and cell turnover. Which of the two processes of cell division
and loss is aected by feeding status and worm size in which way? How do the two
processes inuence each other? To what extent are these turnover processes related to
aging of the cells as well as aging of the organism? There are many open questions and
we started looking into some of them. For example, we have discussed a theoretical
framework for measurements from the cellular to organismal scale and also analyzed
preliminary data, which suggests an age-dependent replacement of cells. Eventually,
we aim to develop a comprehensive picture of how cell turnover and organism growth
is controlled.
This thesis addresses various aspects of growth, cell turnover and scalable body plan
patterning in atworms. It illustrates the sheer diversity of biological processes, which
are fascinating for biologists and physicists alike. Within a collaboration between ex-
perimentalists and theoreticians, we applied physical concepts to quantitatively analyze
and interpret experimental data. Importantly, the gained insights enabled us to ask
new questions and to suggest future experiments, which will ultimately help to grow
our general understanding of homeostasis and growth, development and regeneration
in multicellular organisms.
101A. Reaction-diusion systems:
xed points and scaling
A.1. Morphogen dynamics with linear degradation
A.1.1. Reaction, diusion, advection and dilution
Here, we consider general morphogen dynamics in a growing tissue. We assume that
the morphogens are produced by a source term =(~ r) and spread in the system with
an eective diusion coecient Dwhile being subject to linear degradation with rate
. The dynamics can be described by the following convection-diusion equation for
the morphogen concentration C=C(t;~ r) (11, 31)
@tC=Dr2C C+ r 
~ uC
: (A.1)
The last term corresponds to dilution and convection due to tissue growth with a
velocity eld ~ u=~ u(t;~ r).
Spreading of morphogens from a localized source results in graded concentration pro-
les. Many systems can be considered to be homogeneous with respect to all but one
direction (e.g. the x-direction). In this case, the graded proles C=C(t;x) only
depend on the respective spatial coordinate and the dierential equation simplies to
@tC=D@2
xC C+ ux@xC Cr~ u
=D@2
xC (+@yuy+@zuz)C+ @x(uxC): (A.2)
Note that dilution by growth in the directions perpendicular to the graded prole can
eectively be described by a degradation term. For slow growth dynamics, we can
neglect the convection-dilution terms and recover Eq. 2.1.
A.1.2. Steady state solution neglecting tissue growth
The steady state solution of Eq. A.2 can be found in (31). Yet, often the eect of tissue
growth is considered to be negligible or a second order perturbative eect to the solution
of Eq. 2.1. Thus, let us consider this limit of slow tissue growth. Furthermore, Dand
102A.1 Morphogen dynamics with linear degradation
are assumed to be constant in space across the tissue and constant in time within
the time scale of the morphogen dynamics. As a result, the morphogen concentration
approaches a steady state prole of the form
C(x) =c1exp(x=) +c2exp( x=): (A.3)
The steady state solution for reecting boundary conditions is given by
C(x) =

The square-root of Dandin the amplitude also emerges if there is no degradation in
the source region, see Appendix A.1.4.
A.1.3. Relaxation to the steady state
The degradation rate denes the time scale of relaxation to the steady state of Eq. 2.1.
Let us consider a concentration C(t;x) =C(x)+c(t;x) that deviates from the steady
state by a perturbation c(t;x). The dynamics of c(t;x) are described by
@tc=D@2

While we obtain a power law inside the source, the expression outside the source is
identical to the limit wof Eq. A.4.
A.2. Gradient scaling with expander
A.2.1. On the scaling with an autonomously controlled expander
We consider a three-dimensional domain of volume V=AL, in which the graded
morphogen prole forms along the x-direction of length L, whereasAdenotes the
cross-sectional area. Now, we aim to achieve scaling with respect to some part of the
systemL1withL=L1+L2. For example, L1could be the target tissue without the
morphogen source (if L2=w) or the whole system (if L2= 0).
The expander dynamics are described by
@tE=DEr2E EE+E (A.11)
with a constant diusion term DEand the terms for degradation E=E(x) and
production E=E(x) that depend on the position in the tissue. In the limit of a fast
diusing expander, the general steady state of Eq. A.11 is given by
E=hEi/hEi; (A.12)
where
hEi=1
VZ
EdV andhEi=1
VZ
sEdV (A.13)
denote the spatial averages. In order to achieve scaling of the morphogen prole with
respect toL1, the expander level has to be a function of L1in the steady state. Hence,
hEiandhEimust not depend on L1in the same way.
104A.2 Gradient scaling with expander
If the expander is degraded everywhere in the system part of length L1und produced
in a source of constant width wElike in Eq. 2.9, we recover the result from Eq. 2.10 by
computing
hEi=EAL1
V;hEi=EAwE
V: (A.14)
The steady state of the expander would be a function of L1and thus could couple to the
morphogen dynamics to generate scaling. Analogously, degradation could happen only
at the boundary in a stripe of width wEand production might be turned on everywhere
along the length L1, thus
hEi=EAwE
V;hEi=EAL1
V(A.15)
would also make Ea function of L1.
A.2.2. Scaling by expander feedback with a switch-like production
We assume that the expander is suppressed by the morphogen in a switch-like manner
according to Eq. 2.9 and discuss implications for scaling and robustness of the feedback
schemes.
By combining Eq. 2.14 and the steady state solution for reecting boundary conditions
given by Eq. 2.3, we obtain

sinh(w=)
sinh(L=)cosh(wE=) =Cth: (A.16)
We can derive a relationship between andEby replacing w

: (A.17)
In order to illustrate the behavior of the feedback system, we are considering the two
limiting cases of (i) a scaling morphogen source with w=wLand (ii) a constant
morphogen source. For both, we assume that there exists a perfectly scaling steady
state with=Land a constant scaling factor . Next, we show what this implies
for the coupling between expander and morphogen and discuss the consequences.
(i) For a scaling morphogen source, the following relation between andEhas to
hold in order for the morphogen prole to scale in the steady state:

that it is not possible to achieve scaling by only adjusting the diusion coecient D

instead ofbecause this equation does not depend on D. Eq. A.18 challenges the
stability of the feedback loop because the expander has a suppressing eect on the
morphogen (at least in the steady state), while according to our Eq. 2.9 the morphogen
also suppresses the expander. Thus, this feedback tends to be unstable.

Now, either of both, orD, can be adjusted for scaling. The question on the stability
is a bit more complicated than in the case above, where an increase in results in a
decrease of the morphogen level everywhere in the system. In contrast, for example,
an increase in Dresults in a decrease of the morphogen level close to the morphogen
source and an increase at the other side of the system because the morphogen is dis-
tributed more homogeneously. In consequence, the feedback can be stable in a limited
size range, as long as the resulting expander source is suciently far away from the
morphogen source. As the size of the expander source changes stronger than linearly
withL(compare to Eq. 2.10), the system will eventually reach a size at which this is
not fullled anymore. Analogously, if is adjusted, there also is a size limit. At this
size,is too small such that the eect of Eonis positive according to Eq. A.19.
The size limit corresponds to larger than w, which is likely the case for most of the
systems as wis kept constant.
A.2.3. Scaling by expander feedback with a graded production
The step-like production term in Eq. 2.12 yields rather complicated relationships be-
tween expander and morphogen dynamics, see Eq. A.18 and A.19. Instead, when
considering a non-linear production term
@tE(t;x) =DE@2
xE(t;x) EE(t;x) +EC(x)h(A.20)
with an arbitrary real number h, one obtains analogous results in a more general and
much clearer fashion. The exponent hcan be positive or negative, corresponding to
an enhancing or a repressing eect on the source size, respectively. The term can
be understood as an approximation to a Hill function for concentrations below the
saturation.
The expander concentration in the steady state for the limit of fast diusion is

106A.3 Linear stability analysis of a Turing system
Again, we will distinguish between the limiting cases of (i) a scaling morphogen source
and (ii) a morphogen source of constant size.
(i) For a scaling source, we obtain from Eq. 2.3
E=E
E

I1(L=))/E 1=h; (A.22)
whereI1is a short-hand form of the integral term. In analogy to the switch-like source
in Section A.2.2, we cannot obtain scaling by solely adjusting the diusion properties.
If the degradation rate is adjusted, the steady state tends to be unstable, irrespective
of the exponent h, which characterizes whether the morphogen has an enhancing or
suppressing eect.
(ii) If we assume wis constant, it follows
E=E

withI2denoting the integral. A corresponding expression like in Eq. A.24 can be
derived without the limit wif there is no morphogen degradation in the source,
see Appendix A.1.4. As before, there can be a stable scaling xed point if either or
Dis controlled, yet only in a limited size range.
A.3. Linear stability analysis of a Turing system
A.3.1. Eigenvalues of the linearized reaction-diusion matrix

where \Tr" denotes the trace and \Det" denotes the determinant. The properties of
the eigenvalues can be summarized in the Tr-Det-diagram in Fig. A.1(a). If Tr[ Ms]2<
4 Det[Ms], both eigenvalues are complex and, in fact, are complex conjugates of each
other. For Tr[ Ms]<0 both real parts are negative, otherwise both real parts are
positive.
Instead, if Tr[ Ms]2<4 Det[Ms], both eigenvalues are real. For Det[ Ms]>0 both
eigenvalues have the same sign: a positive sign for Tr[ Ms]>0 and a negative sign for
Tr[Ms]<0. This can be easily seen from

108A.3 Linear stability analysis of a Turing system
Finally, for Det[ Ms]<0 both eigenvalues are real but of opposite sign.
For the homogeneous steady state to be stable with respect to homogeneous perturba-
tion (s= 0), both real parts of the eigenvalues qI
0; qII
0have to be negative. Thus, the
matrixM0should be located in the second quadrant, where
Tr(M0)<0 and Det( M0)>0: (A.28)
For the homogeneous steady state to be unstable with respect to inhomogeneous per-
turbation ( s6= 0), at least one of the eigenvalues qI

shas to have a positive real

Tr(Ms) =M1

Thus, the instability for s6= 0 has to correspond to the third quadrant, for which both
eigenvalues are real and one of them is positive:
Det(Ms)<0 withs6= 0: (A.30)
Note that Tr( Ms) decreases with increasing s, while Det( Ms) rst decreases and later
increases again according to

As a consequence, the eigenvalues of a Turing system depend on the mode number sas

the system is linearly unstable with respect to the corresponding modes.
A.3.2. The principle of local activation and lateral inhibition
We derive necessary conditions for spontaneneous pattern formation in a two-component
reaction diusion system. This section is based on analogous derivations in the litera-
ture (64, 65, 146, 195, 221). For the following, we dene

109A. REACTION-DIFFUSION SYSTEMS: FIXED POINTS & SCALING
The last two inequalities can be combined to
RAADB> RBBDA+DADB(2s=L )2: (A.36)
Eq. A.33 tells us that at least one of the two species has to have a self-inhibiting eect.
Here, we choose species B:RBB<0. From Eq. A.36, we see that the other one, i.e. A,
has to be self-enhancing: RAA>0. From Eq. A.34 follows that RABRBA<0. The
cross-reaction terms must be of opposing signs.
AsRBARAB<0 andRBB DB(2s=L )2<0 in Eq. A.35, it follows that
RAA DA(2s=L )2>0: (A.37)
The diusion coecient DAof the self-activator has to be suciently small for certain
modes to become unstable (\local activation"). This becomes even more apparent if we
consider the reaction term RA=AP(A;B) AAlike in Eq. 2.18. Now, the char-
acteristic wavelength of the reaction-diusion equation has to be suciently small in
comparison to the system size: ( A=L)2<(A@AP
A
h;B
h=A 1)=(2s)2. The weaker
the self-activating eect and the larger the wave number sof the perturbation, the
smallerAhas to be.
Finally, from Eq. A.36, we obtain RAADB> RBBDA. With Eq. A.33, hence
RAA< RBB, we see that the self-inhibitor has to diuse faster than the self-activator
(\lateral inhibition"):
DB>DA: (A.38)
A.4. Motivation for the Hill function
The production function P(A;B) is a switch-like element that takes two inputs and com-
pares them. In a biological system the inputs are the concentrations of two molecules
that bind to the receptors of a cell. We discuss two possibilities to compare the concen-
trations of activator Aand the inhibitor Bby simple generic mechanisms that describe
binding and unbinding to receptors. The number of unbound receptors on a cell is
given byQ. The output could be the number of receptors QAthat are bound to the
activator molecule.
1. Case: The activator Abinds to the receptor Qwhile the inhibitor Bleads to
unbinding of A. The dynamic equation for concentration of receptors bound to Ais
_QA=1Ah1Q 2Bh2QA 3QA; (A.39)
110A.4 Motivation for the Hill function
whereh1andh2describe cooperativity eects for binding and unbinding. For example,
if the activator only binds in pairs, h1= 2. The coecients 1,2and3are the rates
of binding as well as induced and spontaneous unbinding. If the total concentration of
receptorsQ0=Q+QAis constant, the steady state reads
QA=1Ah1Q0
3+2Bh2+1Ah1h=h1=h2      !
3=01Q0(A=B)h
2=1+ (A=B)h: (A.40)
If the cooperativity exponents are the same and the activator rarely unbinds spona-
neously, the standard Hill function is recovered. A nite 36= 0 allows to compute the
limitA=B= 0.
2. Case: We have seen that if the inhibitor facilitates the unbinding of the activator,
we obtain a Hill function for the concentration of receptors bound to the activator.
Another option for implementing the inhibiting eect is competitive binding. Here, the
inhibitor binds to the same receptors as the activator and thus blocks activator binding.
Now, the dynamic equations are
_QA=1Ah1Q 2QA (A.41)
_QB=3Bh2Q 4QB (A.42)
_Q= (1Ah1+3Bh2)Q+2QA+4QB: (A.43)
In the steady state Eq. A.41 results in
Q=2
1Ah1QA (A.44)
and Eq. A.42 yields
QB=3Bh2
4Q=3Bh2(Q0 QA)
4+3Bh2(A.45)
withQ=Q0 QA QB, again assuming a constant total receptor number Q0. When
inserting these two equations in the steady state of Eq. A.43, we nally get
 (1Ah1+3Bh2)2
1Ah1QA+2QA+43Bh2(Q0 QA)
4+3Bh2= 0

111A. REACTION-DIFFUSION SYSTEMS: FIXED POINTS & SCALING
This is also a Hill function with exactly the same structure as the one above. It becomes
apparent that this function stands for a wide class of realizations of a logical element
that compares the magnitude of two inputs in a biological system.
A.5. Homogeneous steady state of our Turing system

dotted line to the right side of Eq. A.48. The intersections mark the steady state value

chosen to ensure the existence of a steady state and to avoid articial oscillations in the
simulations. Moreover, it establishes the correspondence between the theta function
and the Hill function in the limit of h!1 .
Next, we will show that only the case of A
hB
hensures spontaneous pattern formation
irrespectively of h. For this, we explicitly perform a linear stability analysis of our
specic Turing system. The matrix of Eq. A.25 for the linearized system reads

arbitrarily large h. In our parameter sets of Chapter 2, we have chosen B=A= 2.
A.6. Inhomogenous steady states of our Turing system
A.6.1. First order steady state solution
First, we solve Eq. 2.18 of our Turing system with a step-like production function by
assuming a single source region which is touching the boundary as shown in Fig. A.3(a).
We refer to this as the (1 ;1)-pattern. The general steady state solution for A
(1;1)is a
piecewise function
A
in(x) =Ain;1ex=A+Ain;2e x=A+A

A
out(x) =Aout;1ex=A+Aout;2e x=A for`<x<L (A.60)
for the region inside and outside the source. In order to determine the four constant
factors, we use the two reecting boundary conditions and two continuity conditions at
the source boundary:

0= 0 (A.61)

From Eq. A.61-A.62, we obtain Ain;1=Ain;2andAout;1=Aout;2e 2L=A, respectively.
Thus, the solution becomes

A.6.2. Source size of the rst order steady state
For the step-like production function, the source size is dened by
A

FA(`) =BA

2
1 sinh(L= 2`=)
sinh(L=)
: (A.70)
Next, we show that the source size `has only one non-trivial solution. First, we compute
F(0) = 0;F(L=2) = 1=2;F(L) = 1; (A.71)
and we see that `= 0 is always a solution to Eq. A.69. The curve F(`) is essentially a
shifted hyperbolic sine function und is monotonously increasing
@`F(`) =cosh(2`= L=)
sinh(L=)>0: (A.72)
The largest slope is found at the interval bounds:
@`F(`)
0=@`F(`)
L=1
tanh(L=): (A.73)
115A. REACTION-DIFFUSION SYSTEMS: FIXED POINTS & SCALING
In particular, we see that
@1
tanh(L=)
=2L= sinh(2L=)
22sinh(L=)2<0 because L=> 0: (A.74)
Thus, the larger the smaller the slope at `= 0 and`=L. In consequence, the
curve forBlies below the curve for Aif`<L= 2 and above if `>L= 2, as shown in
Fig. A.3(b). We can demonstrate this fact explicitly by computing
@F(`) =(L `)`
3sinh(L=)2sinh(2`=)
2`= sinh(2L= 2`=)
2(L `)=
70 if`7L=2:
(A.75)
Therefore, FA(`) and FB(`) always have three intersection points at 0, L=2 andL. If
we now consider Eq. A.69 with AB<BAandA<B(as required for the Turing
system to form patterns, see Section A.5), `=Lis not a solution anymore and the
second solution is shifted to smaller values of `(intersection with dashed blue line in
Fig. A.3(b)).
In summary, there is always a solution with `= 0 (no source). Additionally, for our
Turing condition ABBA, there can be a second solution with a nite source
size`<L= 2 if
BA
ABAtanh(L=A)<Btanh(L=B): (A.76)
ForAB<BA, there are no further solutions. The condition of Eq. A.76 marks a
bifurcation point of the system, beyond which the (1 ;1)-solution exists in addition to
the (0;0)-solution.
From Eq. A.76, we see that Ais constrained by either LorB, depending on which
one is smaller. If LB, the equation becomes
tanh(L=A)<AB
BAL=A: (A.77)
ForAB<BA, this is only fullled if L=Ais large enough. In contrast for LB,
we obtain
A<AB
BAB: (A.78)
ForAB<BA, this is only fullled if Ais suciently smaller than B.
Finally, we consider two limiting cases of Eq. A.70:
F(`) =1

Note that the absolute value of 1  2`=Lis smaller than 1. Thus, for LBand
LA, we obtain `=L= (AB)=(2BA), see Fig. 2.7.
116A.6 Inhomogenous steady states of our Turing system
A.6.3. Hierarchy of higher order steady states
We can successively derive the higher order steady states. First, we consider the
second order solution with two sources at the boundaries, denoted as (2 ;2)-pattern,
see Fig. A.6.4(a). Thus, there are maxima of concentration A
(2;2)andB
(2;2)at each
boundary. Furthermore, there is a minimum for each concentration in between the two
source regions. We now prove that the system is completely symmetric as depicted in
Fig. A.6.4(b). For that it is sucient to show that the minima for A
(2;2)andB
(2;2)are
at the same position, i.e. LA=LB. Let us consider the solutions left of the respective
minima in Fig. A.6.4(a). These solutions correspond to the (1 ;1)-pattern, which we
have characterized above. If the minima are at the same position ( LA=LB), there is
at most one `with 0<`<L in agreement with A
(1;1)(`) =B
(1;1)(`), see Section A.6.2.
However,B
(1;1)(`) is a strictly monotonic function of LBif`>0:
@LBB
(1;1)(`) = Bsinh(`=B) cosh(`=B)
sinh(L=B)2B<0: (A.80)
Therefore, there is no other choice of LBalso solving the equation for `. In consequence
we conclude that LA=LBin the steady state.
ForLA=LB, we can cut the (2,2)-pattern at this position, which results in two (1,1)-
patterns. But since these two (1,1)-patterns have in fact the same concentration Aat
their common boundary, their system size must be equal. An analogous reasoning can
be applied to the (1 ;0)-pattern. Finally, Fig. A.6.4(b) exemplies that any higher order
pattern can be considered as a concatenation of (1 ;1)-patterns as the basic building
blocks. Each adjacent pair of these fundamental sections is either a (1 ;0)-pattern or a
(2;2)-pattern and thus completely symmetric. In consequence, any higher order pattern
can be constructed by a concatenation of (1 ;1)-patterns of identical size.
A.6.4. Stability of the inhomogeneous steady state of our Turing system
We are probing the stability of the inhomogeneous steady states in various ways. First,
we can add a set of small perturbations to the steady state proles and monitor the
relaxation behavior in numerical simulations. Second, we can start with a linear com-
bination of two steady state patterns with varying weights and observe to which steady
state they converge, as shown in Fig. 2.8(b). Finally, for the case of the Hill-type pro-
duction function, we can numerically perform a linear stability analysis, as we will show
next.

If the largest eigenvalue of the linear operator matrix is negative, the steady state
is stable and this maximum eigenvalue provides the time scale of relaxation of the
slowest decaying mode. If at least one eigenvalue is positive, the steady state is linearly
unstable.
Fig. A.5 shows the maximum eigenvalue for the (1 ;0)-pattern as a function of the system
size. We can determine the lower bound for which this pattern becomes stable, as
illustrated in Fig. 2.8. For none of the inhomogeneous patterns, we observe a maximum
system size, at which these patterns would become unstable again.

A.7. On our scalable Turing system
A.7.1. A homogeneous dynamic state for low expander levels
For low expander values, the concentrations in the Turing system with expander feed-
back become homogenous. Here, we consider the adiabatic limit for which the expander
relaxation is much faster than the dynamics of the Turing molecules. In consequence,
the expander tightly follows the much slower dynamics of the inhibitor concentration
B:
E=E
EB: (A.90)
It exists a dynamic state of the Turing system for which the concentrations Aand
Brelax in synchrony such that the ratio =B=A stays constant. As a result, the
Hill-type production function has a constant value P(A;B) =g() given by
g() =1
1 +h: (A.91)
The ratiois is obtained from
@t= 0
Bg() BEB Ag()+AEB= 0
g() =E
EA B
A B: (A.92)
The system can leave the homogeneous regime if Eincreases. For this, Bhas to
decrease, according to Eq. A.90. We have discussed for Eq. 3.11 that this requires
g()<`=L, where`=L= (EB)=(EB). For the threshold where g() =`=L, we
obtain
E
EA B
A B=EB
EB
=BA
BB: (A.93)
Thus, the ratio B=A equals the ratio of the homogeneous steady state concentrations
B
h=A
h. Therefore, from g() =`=Lfollows that f(0;0)=`=L.
120A.7 On our scalable Turing system
A.7.2. Generalized scalable Turing system
We can generalize our approach of scalable Turing patterning by considering the fol-
lowing generic equations for A,BandE
@tA=AP(A;B) +RA(A;E) +DA@2
xA (A.94)
@tB=BP(A;B) +RB(B;E) +DB@2
xB (A.95)
@tE=E+LE
RA(A;E);RB(B;E)
+DE@2
xE: (A.96)
Here, RAandRBare generic functions fullling the Turing conditions and LEis a
linear function of RA(A;E) and RB(B;E). By computing the spatial averages in the
steady state, one obtains
E+hLE
RA(A;E);RB(B;E)
i= 0
E+LE
hRA(A;E)i;hRB(B;E)i
= 0
E+LE
AhPi;BhPi
= 0: (A.97)
IfRA,RBandLEare chosen such that ~LE(hPi) =LE(AhPi;BhPi) is a monotonic
function inhPi, this uniquely determines the source size in the steady state. Thus, if
a steady state exists, the size of the source will be independent of the system size.
Let us again consider a homogeneous expander distribution. Furthermore, we assume
that the relaxation of the Turing system is much faster than the relaxation of the
expander. Thus, Eq. A.94-A.95 dene the size of the source as a function of slowly
varyingE. The intersection of this nullcline with the solution for hPifrom Eq. A.97
provides the steady state values of E. For the steady state to be linearly stable, it
requires that @hPi~LE(hPi)@EhPijE<0.
A.7.3. Scaling of downstream targets with a constant amplitude
One important feature of our scalable Turing system is that the amplitude of the
morphogens increases quadratically with L, see Section 3.7. This is a general property
of such scaling mechanisms for which the degradation rate is adjusted, see Section 2.4.5.
As the degradation rate changes proportional to L 2, the products AAandBBare
characterized by a constant amplitude independent of system size. If the cell responds
to this ux, the expression of down-stream targets scales with a constant amplitude.
Yet, how might the cell read out the degradation ux?
Signaling often requires binding of the molecules to receptors on the cell surface. The
concentration of activator molecules bound to receptors is Ab/AbA, whereAb
121A. REACTION-DIFFUSION SYSTEMS: FIXED POINTS & SCALING
is the binding rate. If the molecules become internalized or degraded upon binding,
this binding removes the molecules from the system and the binding rate Abin fact
contributes to the degradation rate A.
As a simple example, let us consider the following dynamics of the bound molecules
@tAb=AbA ArAb: (A.98)
Free molecules bind with rate Aband bound molecules are removed with rate Ar.
The steady state of this equation is
A
b=Ab
ArA: (A.99)
If spontaneous degradation of the free molecules can be neglected in comparison to
binding and internalization, it follows that A=Aband the cells read out the ux
AA. In this scenario, the expander could be a co-receptor that controls the binding
rate and thus the eective degradation rate in a size-dependent manner. The down-
stream targets would perfectly scale with a constant amplitude.
A.7.4. On knockout experiments in scalable Turing systems
In Chapter 3, we presented a simple mechanism that couples a classical Turing system
including two molecules of concentration AandBto the dynamics of an additional
expander molecule. Here, we will show that knockout of AorB(for example by RNAi
feedings) can yield misleading results.
If the production of the activator is blocked, one observes that both concentrations fade
away, see Fig. A.6(a). Thus, one would correctly conclude that AactivatesB. Yet,
after removing the inhibitor from the system, both concentrations decrease as well. In
particular, Ais vanishing after an initial increase because of the indirect eect via E.
In consequence one would conclude that Bis activating A, despite its direct inhibiting
eect within the Turing feedback loop.
In the case of the atworms, the Wnt/ -catenin system has an instructive role for tail
identity. RNAi experiments indicate that respective pathway components are expressed
in the tail and have a positive eect on themselves and each other. In contrast, the
inhibitors of this system reside in the head. This is not in agreement with any of the
two most simple Turing systems based on two key players. Fig. 1.10 illustrates that we
would expect either additional inhibiting eects of molecules that are expressed in the
same region or additional activating eects of molecules that are expressed on opposite
ends of worm. Including an expander feedback could solve this problem, as shown in
122A.7 On our scalable Turing system
Fig. A.6(b). A Turing system of the rst type, with both Turing molecules expressed in
the same region, might appear like a mutually enhancing feedback during gene knock-
out. A Turing system of the second type, with both Turing molecules expressed on
opposite ends, might appear like a mutually suppressing feedback.
Monitoring the dynamics of the concentrations upon RNAi feeding over time is more
informative than endpoint assays, see Fig. A.6(a). After knockout of the inhibitor, the
activator rst expands before the pattern vanishes, hinting at the suppressive eect of
B.

124B. On the numerical solution
of reaction-diusion equations
B.1. Euler method and Courant criterion
A reaction-diusion equation of type
@tC(t;x) = C(x;t) +D@2
xC(t;x) (B.1)
describes diusion and linear degradation of a chemical species of concentration Cin a
one-dimensional domain. It can be solved numerically by discretizing time and space
and using the Euler method as the most simple approach (163). The concentration Ci

In order for the Euler update to be numerically stable and not to violate causality, the
following Courant-L evy-Friedrich criterion has to be fullled (163)
t<2x2
4D+x2: (B.3)
In this thesis, we often analyze systems of several coupled reaction-diusion equations.
At least one of which usually contains a very fast diusing chemical species, like the
inhibitor in the Turing system or the expander in Chapter 2 and 3. Usually 4 Df
x2withDfof the fastest diusing species and of any species. Thus,  t <
x2=(2Df) has to be chosen to be very small. Note that  xis bounded from above
especially by the non-homogeneity of the slowest diusing species. Yet, the time scale
of relaxation to the steady state is determined by the reaction rates . The number of
iterations to reach the steady state is of order O

is very large as stated above. Next, we show how to avoid such long computing times.

B.2. Algorithmic speed-up using a convolution with a Gauss
kernel
If diusion of one or several species is fast in comparison to the other processes of the
system, we can apply a separation of time scales to avoid long computing times. During
one rather large time step of the Euler scheme that would violate the Courant criterion
due to the fast diusion but would be still in agreement with the other slow processes,
we account for the fast diusion by using the analytical solution of the pure diusion
equation

128C. Worm handling and
measurements of size and shape
C.1. Worm handling
If not specied otherwise, we use a clonal line of an asexual strain of Schmidtea mediter-
ranea (28, 185). Worms were maintained at 20C as described in (35). Other atworm
species were taken from the atworm collection established by the lab of Jochen Rink
(CBG, Dresden).
Large worms kept in isolation increasingly tend to ssion, while social crowding is
known to reduce ssioning rates (48, 161). In order to prevent ssioning during long
term measurements but still track individual worms, we added small worm pieces in the
dishes of large worms. In long term experiments, we occasionally also added antibiotics
(ciprooxacin, gentamicin) to ensure that the worms stay healthy during the entire
time course.
C.2. Image acquisition
Flatworms were placed one at a time into a plastic petri dish (90 mm) and lmed using
a Nikon macroscope (AZ 100M, 0.5x objective) and a Nikon camera set-up (DS-Fi1,
frame rate 3 Hz, exposure time 6 ms, total observation period 15 s, resolution 1280 x 960
pixel, conversion factor 44 pixel/mm). The movies were converted from AVI (provided
by the Nikon imaging software) to MP4 using Handbreak, reducing the bit-size by a
factor of 30 and facilitating further processing. For this purpose, we wrote a bash script
which calls HandbrakeCLI (the command line interface version) and transcodes the AVI
les using the H.264 standard for video compression and xed optimized settings. We
carefully tested the conversion procedure to exclude distorting eects on the data. It
turns out that the worm tracking and shape analyses are even more robust if we rst
transcode the les in comparison to loading the AVI les directly into the MATLAB
program.
129C. WORM HANDLING AND MEASUREMENTS OF SIZE AND
SHAPE
For the size measurements, we aimed to obtain movies in which the worms are moving
rather straight and stretched out. This behavior corresponds to a ight response which
can be seen after the worms have been exposed to light. After the worms are placed
in the center of the petri dish, they try to escape the illumination of the macroscope
by moving towards the slightly darker region near the rim of the dish. The stage
is adjusted such that the worms traverse the eld of view and are imaged just after
an initial acceleration phase. Student helpers have been thoroughly trained at the
macroscope to strictly adhere to the xed imaging protocol.
C.3. Extracting size and shape from worm movies
Movies were analyzed o-line using custom-made MATLAB software, see Fig. C.1. A
rst shape proxy was determined from movie frames via edge detection using a canny-
lter, followed by a dilation-erosion cycle and a lling of the shape. If possible, the
shape was extracted twice for each frame { with and without background correction.
By comparing the two results, the program can reduce errors from particles touching
the worm boundary. In a subsequent renement step, the worm perimeter was adjusted
by nding the steepest drop in intensity along directions transverse to the perimeter
proxy. This procedure together with interpolation steps allowed us to extract the worm
shape with sub-pixel accuracy,
After the perimeter was determined, we were able to compute further quantities such as
the worm area. The midline was obtained by searching for points with equal distances
to both sides of the worm boundary. Due to the large body plasticity, the measured
quantities such as worm area or length can easily vary by up to 30% during normal,
rather stretched gliding motion. It requires an extensive imaging training and a large
number of worms to extract reliable and reproducible data. Often, we analyzed several
movies per worm and experimental condition. In contrast to the biological variability,
the analysis software works very robustly and can cope with dierent noise levels and
manyfold intensity variations.

131D. Shape reconstruction
and worm bending
D.1. On the reconstruction of a closed worm outline
In order to reconstruct a worm shape from a given radial distance prole, we have to
determine the constant increment d^salong the worm perimeter such that the outline
closes on itself. This corresponds to
X
ii= 2 (D.1)
with the angle ibetween two consecutive radii ^ iand ^i+1. The angle iis monotonously
increasing with d^sfor radially convex shapes.P
iican even be monotonously in-
creasing with d^sif the shapes are not strictly radially convex but close to it. For a
monotonously increasingP
ii, there exists one choice for d^ssuch that Eq. D.1 is
fullled. Small variations of the radial distance prole yield similar results for d^s.
D.2. On the reconstruction of head shapes
The head perimeter does not completely close on its own. Instead of Eq. D.1, the
following condition has to be fullled
X
ii= 2 0; (D.2)
including the opening angle 0towards the trunk. The angle 0can be determined un-
der the assumption of an approximately symmetric head shape. For Nradial distances
^idescribing the head, we obtain
0= arccos(^N=2=^1) + arccos(^N=2=^N): (D.3)
132E. On growth and cell turnover
E.1. Signatures of aging in atworms
Large and small worms are not only dierent in size but also show size-dependent
changes in system behavior, which have been previously related to characteristics of
more adult or juvenile animals, respectively (15, 18, 71, 111, 133). For this, we need
to distinguish between two dierent notions of \aging". The rst one refers to the
progression of the physical time since birth. Secondly, there would be physiological
aging that is determined by varying characteristics of the body such as sexual maturity
and also symptoms of decline as well as an increased mortality. Aging in the second
sense might potentially be independent of the life time of the organism and might
instead rather depend on its size or environmental conditions.
For sexual atworms, it has in fact been reported that growth, metabolic rate, regene-
ration abilities and reproduction change with age (1, 86, 92, 111). Additionally, aging
is often attributed to a decreasing length of telomeres (i.e. the end regions of the
chromosomes) with each cell division. Indeed, this telomere erosion has been described
in sexual Smed and it correlates with the total life time of the worm (213). In contrast,
other features seem to rather depend on size instead of the life time. For example,
sexual atworms develop reproductive organs when growing but also reabsorb their
germ line cells again when shrinking during starvation periods (30, 33, 140, 193).
For asexual worms, as we consider in the experiments, aging eects are even more
dicult to discuss. There is no well-dened birth and, at most, ssioning could be
considered as death and birth at the same time. Nevertheless, asexual Smed still show
size-dependent physiological changes. For example, the ssioning rate increases for
large worms (215) and precursor cells of the germ line, which still exist in asexual
atworms, show a similar size-dependence as the germ line in sexual worms (84, 230).
Telomere erosion has also been observed in asexual Smed , yet the length is restored
during regeneration in contrast to the sexual strains (213). In this sense, physiological
aging in asexual worms might be considered to be reversible and regeneration might be
interpreted as a rejuvenation event, which also includes the renewal of many somatic
133E. ON GROWTH AND CELL TURNOVER
cells during remodeling (50, 86). It is an interesting question whether the worms also
show a physiologically rejuvenation while starving (86, 91, 140).
In summary, there is some evidence that sexual worms show irreversible signatures of
aging with progression of their life time while asexual strains might be able to return
to a more juvenile state. As a sidenote, sexual worms survive longer than asexual
worms after irradiation (229), which could be due to a reduced turnover rate. One
might speculate that sexual worms rather invest in producing a germ line on the cost
of body maintenance. Such a potentially insucient replacement of damaged cells
and the corresponding deterioration of function alongside with a higher mortality can
be considered as a hallmark of aging (158). However, most importantly, the discussion
shows how dicult it is to unambiguously characterize aging, especially as it is in general
lacking a clear denition (53). It will be left for future works to investigate whether
size-dependent changes in atworms might be linked to aging and rejuvenation.
E.2. Additional size measurements and growth dynamics
In this section, we provide more details and additional measurements of worm sizes and
growth dynamics to back up our discussion in Section 5.2.
We dene the worm area for a particular measurement as the average over the 10 frames
with the largest values. Scaling laws are tted by a robust algorithm with bi-squared
weights. Thus, the spread of the data is assumed to correspond to the measurement
uncertainty. This circumvents the diculties with estimating the error for each data
point from the size measurements. Fig. E.1(a) shows the scaling relation between area
and length for well-fed worms (3 days after feeding). The t yields a scaling exponent
of 1:690:01, which is slightly lower than for the starving worms in Fig. 5.3(a).
As a byproduct of the cell number measurements using histones, Albert Thommen also
determined the protein mass in the worms. Even though the measurements are not
suciently calibrated to obtain absolute numbers, the respective scaling laws might
still be meaningful. While the total mass per cell seems to change with worm size, the
protein content per cell appears to stay rather constant, see Fig. E.1(b). It remains to
validate this result with additional experiments and to investigate whether it could be
linked to potential lipid stores.
Oviedo et al. have counted the number of cintillo cells around the head margin (150). If
we assume an equidistant positioning of these sensory cells and approximate the head
by a semi-circle, the width of the worm head can be considered to be proportional to
the number of cintillo cells, see Fig. E.1(c). The resulting scaling law for the width

with an exponent of 0 :670:03 is in agreement with our measurements of area versus
length.
Upon feeding, worms show a characteristic growth response. The immediate increase
in worm size is mainly due to stung as discussed in Section 5.2.2. When comparing
the feeding response after two weeks of starvation with the peak after one week of
starvation of Fig. 5.4, we see no obvious dependence on feeding history.
When being fed regularly, worms grow and degrow depending on the feeding frequency.
Bagu~ n a et al. have determined the rates of addition and removal of cells in Girardia
tigrina for various feeding conditions (15, 18). From this data, we can back-calculate
the growth rates which they originally measured, see Fig. E.2(a). While the growth
trends are similar to our results, the degrowth rates seem not to vary with size in
contrast to our data, see Fig. E.2(b).
Oviedo et al. have obtained linearly increasing and decreasing functions of the worm
length with time during feeding and starvation, respectively (150). We can compute
growth and degrowth rates from their data sets and compare them to our measurements
in terms of worm length, see Fig. E.2(c). The linear growth behavior yields _L=L/
1=L. Thus, the absolute rates are decreasing for large worms in agreement with our
results. However, the curves do not t our data points very well. They are shifted
downwards even though the growing worms are even fed twice a week. In particular,
the absolute values for the growth rate are smaller than for the degrowth rate, which
contradicts our observation.

Figure E.3.: Dividing stem cells progress through four distinct cell cycle stages, which
can be identied by respective markers. DNA replication happens in S-phase and cells
divide in M-phase, while G1 and G2 are merely resting phases including check points
for error control. We discuss an experiment to measure the cell division rates by
blocking the transition from M-phase to G1 (red cross).
E.3. Measuring cell cycle times
Stem cells move through four distinct cell cycle phases, which can be characterized by
dierent biochemical markers: pcna (all stem cells), clumping pcna (S-phase), cycling
B (G2-phase), H3P (M-phase), see Fig. E.3. An increase of H3P marker has been
measured upon feeding (71). Under the assumption that the duration of the M-phase is
relatively constant, this can be interpreted as an increase in cell division rate. However,
one cannot extract actual rates from this measurement if one does not know the duration
of the M-phase.
Bagu~ n a et al. have performed experiments from which they obtained cell division
rates (12, 13, 15, 18, 176, 178). They blocked the progression through M-phase using
colchicine as indicated by the red cross in Fig E.3, which results in an increasing number
of cells in M-phase. Under the assumption that the M-phase has a constant duration
and cell death can be neglected, the time derivative of the number of accumulating cells
in M is a direct read-out of cell division rate. We plan to perform similar experiments
using the cell cycle markers discussed above, which have not been available for the
previous works. In particular, we aim to reveal how the division rates depend on size
and feeding. By subtracting division rates from growth rates, we will also be able to
extract the corresponding cell loss rates. Thus, we hope to reveal whether the control
points of cell turnover are associated with the mechanisms for the addition or loss of
cells.
Furthermore, the time scale of the rst response upon feeding might also hint at how the
cell division rate is controlled. It has been discussed that there might be a population
of slowly cycling cells that mainly stay in G2 to allow a fast regeneration and feeding
137E. ON GROWTH AND CELL TURNOVER
response (12, 13, 139, 142, 170, 182). This represents a major investment of cellular
resources as G2 cells already have a duplicated DNA. It would also be in contrast to
the arrest in G1, typically observed for other organisms. If we were to measure a very
fast division response, it would support the hypothesis of G2 arrested cells.
E.4. Measuring cell turnover dynamics on the organism level
Here, we discuss the theoretical framework for measuring turnover dynamics on the
organismal level. It will enable us to test and compare various models with specic
assumptions on how cell division and loss rates depend on feeding and worm size.
The experimental approach relies on Histone labeling by heavy isotopes (SILAC). It
is inspired by the measurements of neurogenesis dynamics in adult humans exploiting
the known C14concentration in the atmosphere due to nuclear bomb tests (203). First,
we present the main principles of this paper. Next, we apply the idea to atworms
suggesting an adapted experimental protocol. Finally, we discuss details of histone
labeling.
E.4.1. Measurement of C14reveals dynamics of neurogenesis in humans
First, we briey review the main ideas of the work by Spalding et al. (203) and introduce
our notation. The paper describes a measurement of the turnover of hippocampal
neurons in humans. It is based on the known C14concentration in the atmosphere due
to nuclear bomb tests, which becomes incorporated into the DNA as a label when a new
cells is made. From this, we can compute the total C14concentration in the DNA of a
person of a particular age if we assume a particular model for the turnover dynamics.
This result can then be benchmarked using the measured C14in dead people.
The starting point is that we have a list of several possible scenarios for how cell birth
and cell death depends on each other as well as on the age of the cells and the age of
the person. For each of these scenarios, we can compute a distribution n(A;a) that
describes the number of cells of age ain a person of age A. This distribution changes
over time because of aging (left) and because of cell death (right)
@An(A;a) +@an(A;a) = kloss(A;a)n(A;a); (E.1)
whereklossis the loss rate which might depend on the age of the person as well as the
age of the cell. Cell birth is considered by the boundary condition
n(A;0) =n0(A); (E.2)

wheren0(A) is the inux of cells due to cell division. Cell birth might depend on the
age of the person explicitly but also implicitly by e.g. depending on the number of dying
cells at each time point.
Furthermore, as an initial condition it is assumed that a rst set of cells is made in the
embryo half a year before the person is born, resulting in an initial condition
n( 0:5;a) =(a): (E.3)
This includes a delta function (which is zero for a6= 0), describing the fact that cells
are born with age 0.
By solving the system of Eqs. E.1 - E.3, we determine the number of cells n(A;a) of
ageafor any age Aof the person, given a specic model for kloss(A;a) andn0(A). In
particular, we can predict the age distribution n(Ad;a) in a person who died at age Ad.
For a person who died in year td, we can compute the total concentration of C14label
by
C(td;Ad) =ZAd+0:5
0Cin(td a)n(Ad;a)
N(Ad)da; (E.4)
if the concentration Cin(t) of C14inside the body (which could thus be incorporated
in new cells) is known at any time point. The integral sums over all cells of all ages,
multiplied by the amount of label Cinat the respective time of birth td a.
The result is normalized by the total number of all considered cells in a dead person,
which is given by N(Ad) =RAd+0:5
0n(Ad;a)da. The upper bound of integration reects
the maximum age obtained by cells, which persist during the full life span of the person.
Note that the summand of 0 :5 was missing in the original publication.
139E. ON GROWTH AND CELL TURNOVER
The concentration Cinof C14inside the body is estimated from the known C14concen-
tration in the atmosphere by introducing a heuristic time lag of one year. Variations
in the time lag are claimed not to signicantly change the result.
Dierent turnover models can be rated using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
which avoids over-tting when comparing models with a dierent number of parameters.
In brief, this technique calculates the likelihood that a certain model has generated the
measured data. As a more complex model with more parameters tends to t the data
better, it introduces a simple but mathematically well-justied penalty term for the
number of parameters based on information theory.
E.4.2. Adapting the C14technique to cell turnover in atworms
In contrast to the neurogenesis paper, we need to consider a dierent label than the C14
concentration in the atmosphere for atworms. We choose to use the SILAC protocol
(stable isotope labeling of amino acids) (32). The worms are fed with mouse liver,
in which more than 96% of the amino acid lysine is replaced by the heavy isotope
form13C6-lysine. In consequence, the labeled lysine gets incorporated into proteins
and in particular into histones, which package the DNA in the nucleus. Histones are
believed to be only synthesized when a cell is made and to remain stable throughout
the lifetime of the cell. Thus, the fraction of labeled histones can serve as a read-out
for cell turnover.
The technique from the neurogenesis paper has to be modied due to the unknown initial
age distribution. | In atworms, we encounter two main dierences: On the positive
side, we can directly measure (and to some extent even deliberately vary) the label
content in the body Cin(t). On the negative side, we do not know an initial age
distribution analogous to Eq. E.3. In the following, we suggest experimental protocols
that resolve this problem.
Similar to Eq. E.1-E.2, we can describe the time evolution by
@tn(t;a) +@an(t;a) = kloss(t;a)n(t;a) (E.5)
n(t;0) =n0(t): (E.6)
This set of equations can be solved analytically

0kloss(t a+a0;a0)da0
: (E.7)
140E.4 Measuring cell turnover dynamics on the organism level
The number of cells of age aat timetis the same number that was born at time t a,
but reduced by all the death events in between, described by the exponential term with
the integral over the cell death time course. If we knew or were able to model all the
cell birth and death processes for all times in the past, this solution would give us the
full age distribution at time t. Alternatively, one could only consider birth and death
rates starting from a particular time point, if one knew the initial distribution at this
time, see Eq. E.3.
Unfortunately, in atworms we do neither know the age distribution at one initial time
point nor the full feeding and growth history, which would enable us to model n0and
kloss. Luckily, there are two options to solve this problem, each relies on a particular
assumption.
First option: Assuming a stem cell control model. | If there is no feedback from
kloss(t;a) orn(t;a) on cell birth n0(t) (i.e. mainly negligible apoptosis-induced cell
division), we can determine the age distribution n(t;a) at least partially for all ages
a<t t0, assuming the experiment (i.e. the well-controlled feeding conditions) starts
att0. The longer we perform the experiment, the more of the distribution we can
compute. As cells do not live forever and the number of old cells decays exponentially
(see Eq. E.7), we will approximately obtain the full age distribution with time.
Second option: Assuming the system relaxes to a steady state for a reference feeding
condition. | If we provide a constant feeding condition, for which the worms neither
grow nor degrow, we might assume that the age distribution eventually relaxes to a
steady state n(a), which is a solution to the equation
@an(a) = kloss(a)n(a): (E.8)
This equation can be solved for a particular choice of kloss(a) andn
0:
n(a) =n
0e Ra
0kloss(a0)da0: (E.9)
In order to obtain such a steady state, we would need to constantly provide the worms
with a small and well-controlled amount of food. Even though, theoretically it would
be the most clean approach, experimentally it is rather dicult to frequently pipette a
well-dened amount of food to each worm.
Modied second option: Assuming a quasi-steady state for a reference feeding condition.
|If worms are fed every second week, on average, they will also neither grow nor
degrow but show size oscillations with a frequency of two weeks. Importantly, the
141E. ON GROWTH AND CELL TURNOVER
steady state argument can be modied for such a periodically oscillating quasi-steady
staten(t;a). This quasi-steady state can be used as an initial condition for other
feeding schemes in analogy to Eq. E.3.
E.4.3. Label dynamics after a single feeding event
Here, we illustrate the measurement scheme by discussing the eect of a single feeding
pulse with labeled lysine in a simplied example. The total inux of the amino acid
lysine is given by
JAF=NAF
Fe t=F; (E.10)
whereNAFis the total amount of the amino acid lysine in the gut after feeding and
Fis the digestion time of the food. A certain fraction  AFof the lysine in the food is
assumed to be labeled by heavy isotopes.
After feeding with labeled food, the fraction  Aof the labeled amino acid lysine in-
creases in the animal. Lysine belongs to the building blocks of histones and other
proteins, which also will become labeled by the incorporation the amino acid. As a
simple example, let us assume there are only two proteins in the body that take up
lysine: a fast turnover protein and histone. The result is qualitatively the same, inde-
pendent of the number of proteins that incorporate lysine and might be turned over
at very dierent rates. We dene the label fraction  Hof lysine in histones as the
ratio between all labeled lysine in histones and the total amount of lysine in histones.
Analogously, we also dene the label fraction of the lysine in the fast turnover protein
P.
If we furthermore assume that cell death happens stochastically and does not depend
on the age of the cell, the dynamics of  Aare captured by
@tA=JAF
NA(AF A)+(1 P)NAP
NA(P A)JP+(1 H)NAH
NA(H A)klossN:
(E.11)
Here,NAdenotes the total amount of lysine in the worm, (1  P) is the fraction
of lysine that can be recycled from fast turnover proteins and NAPis the amount of
lysine per protein. Analogously, (1  H) is the fraction of lysine that can be recycled
from histones and NAHis the amount of lysine in all the histones in a cell. The label
fraction of the amino acid only changes via recycling or feeding. Each further protein
that incorporates lysine would be represented by an analogous term.

fast as the label digestion and ten times as fast as the cell turnover. If digestion and the
fast turnover happen at comparable time scales, the gray and the green curves collapse.
(b) Labeling scheme: the label dynamics in the fast turnover protein corresponds to

can be used as a read-out of labeled lysine. Finally, the histones (red) also incorporate
the label on a much longer time scale given by the life times of the cells. Fig. E.5(b)
sketches the main principle of the experiment.

143E. ON GROWTH AND CELL TURNOVER
in the worm (which can be incorporated into histones) can be directly measured by
monitoring the label in high turnover proteins.
E.4.4. Challenges and advantages of the application to atworms
Lacking knowledge about an initial age distribution, we have to rely on experimental
protocols and specic assumptions that eliminate a potential history-dependence. We
can tackle this problem by assuming a periodically varying quasi-steady state when
feeding every second week and maybe independently measure the respective cell birth
rate. We will be able to estimate the time scale of the relaxation to this quasi-steady
state based on the spreading of neoblast clones in irradiated worms. Once it has been
characterized, the quasi-steady state can act as the initial conguration for other feeding
schemes.
As an advantage in atworms, we might be able to deliberately vary the time course of
the internalized label by alternating between labeled and non-labeled food. This might
help to distinguish dierent models for birth rate n0and death rate klossto a higher
resolution. Note that the more Cin(t) or P(t) varies with time, the more details of
the models can be resolved. If the internal label was kept constant, almost any model
would t the data equally well. As a second advantage, we can directly determine the
label in the body using high turnover proteins.
