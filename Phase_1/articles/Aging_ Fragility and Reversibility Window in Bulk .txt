Abstract 
  
Non-reversing relaxation enthalpies ( ΔH
nr) at  glass transitions T g(x) in the P xGexSe1-2x  
ternary  display  wide, sharp and deep global minima (~ 0)  in the  0.09 < x <  0.145 range, within which  T
gs  become thermally reversing. In this reversibility window , 
glasses are found not to age , in contrast to aging  observed for fragile glass compositions 
outside the window .  Thermal reversibility and lack of aging  seem to be  paradigms of 
self-organization which molecular glasses share with protein  structures which repetitively 
and reversibly change conformation near T g and the folding temperature respectively.

2Aging occurs in many materials, both organi c and inorganic.  I norganic crystals age 
under electrical, mechanical, or thermal stresses, often as a result of dislocation motion.  
Aging in organic materials is more complex, occurring as hydrogen bonding configurations are alte red as a result of thermal cycli ng.  The more complex the system, 
the less understood are the causes of aging, and the causes of aging in living systems are 
one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science.  Here we will show that inorganic non-crystalline nanonetworks are universally divi ded into three regimes of composition, two 
of which age rapidly, while the third regime scar cely ages at all.  The third regime defines 
a narrow window of composition that appears to have much in common mechanically 
with selected organic nanonetworks, namely the polypeptide chains that form proteins. 
Aging is not evident in data obtained by c onventional structural methods (diffraction, 
infrared and Raman spectra, magnetic resonance) , but it is measured very accurately by 
thermally modulated scanning calorimetry. 
 
New ideas on the nature of glass transitions ( T
g ) have emerged in recent years from 
examination1-3 of the non-reversing relaxation enthalpy  (ΔHnr) associated with  T g. The 
endotherm is signature of ergodicity breaking events when structural  arrest of a glass 
forming liquid occurs near T g. Examined as a function of mean coordination number, r, 
of network glasses, the endotherm ( ΔHnr) is found to nearly vanish1-5 across 
compositional windows,  rc(1) < r < rc(2),  wherein glass transitions become thermally 
reversing . Furthermore, these reversibility windows  are found to be closely related to 
variations in Raman optical elasticities3-5. Distinct elastic power-laws are seen in the 
composition regimes: r < rc(1)), in  rc(1) < r < rc(2) (the window), and above   
 3
3 r > rc(2) 3-5.  Theoretical support for the existence of these elastic phases comes from 
several related considerations, namely, the counting of Lagrangian constraints6, graph 
theory7 and numerical simulations7,8. From these considerations J.C.Phillips and M.F. 
Thorpe have identified6-8 the existence of three generic elastic phases as a function of r; 
floppy, intermediate and stressed rigid.  Thus, rc(1) and rc(2), mark the onset  and end of 
the reversibility window , and are the two phase boundaries  between these three elastic  
phases .  Intermediate phases are generally cen tered on mean coordination numbers close 
to 2.40, and are thought to consist of isostatic (rigid  but unstressed) structures.  In the 
present work we examine the rates of networ k aging in the three composition regimes as 
measured by changes in the kinetics of the glass transition in samples relaxed at room 
temperature (far below the glass transition temperatures) over several months.  Our 
results show that strain plays an important pa rt in network aging, a nd that the absence of 
long-range strains is a necessa ry condition for non-aging.  
 
Intuitively one might anticipate non-aging in th e very stable and self -organized structure 
that could exist between the two less stable structure regimes, namely floppy  structures 
with polymer chain entanglements fr ozen upon quenching and overconstrained stressed-
rigid  structures with locked-in extra bonds on the other. The caveat, however, is the 
possible presence of nanoscale phase separation  which invalidates mean field constraint 
counting particularly in the would be optimally  constrained phase.  Such separation often 
occurs in binary selenides,  ( T or Pn)xSe1-x, where T is a tathogen (Si, Ge)  and  Pn a 
pnictide ( P,As), and manifests it self in global maxima of  T g(x) near chemical 
thresholds10,11 ( Fig. 1a ).  However, in ternary selenides, TxPnxSe1-x, containing equal  
 4
4fractions  of T and Pn atoms, these global maxima are conspicuously absent12, and T g(x) 
is found to increase monotoni cally  with x , as illus trated for the case of  T = Ge, Pn = P 
ternary in Fig.1a . In this Letter, we identify the r eversibility window  (0.09 < x < 0.145) in 
the P xGexSe1-2x ternary and find it to be wide, sh arp and deep. Furthermore, glasses in the 
window  are found not to age, in sharp contrast to aging observed for glass compositions 
outside the window. Thermal reversibility and absence of aging  appear to be common 
features of both glasses  in reversibility windows  and proteins in folding states13,14, and 
are connected with structural  self-organization  of these disordered networks.          
 Our dry, homogenized samples were pr epared as described previously
3.  Glass transition 
temperatures, T g(x) , and non-reversing relaxation enthalpy, ΔHnr(x) , were established 
using a model 2920 MDSC from TA instruments. Measurements were performed on fresh (3 weeks) and aged (3 and 5 mo nths) samples relaxed at 300K. We find T
g(x) to 
increase monotonically with x in the 0 < x < 0.25 range ( Fig.1a ). Variations in ΔHnr(x) 
show ( Fig. 1b ) a global minimum in the 0.09 < x < 0.145 range that becomes relatively 
sharper and deeper as the glasses outside the window age. In the 0.20 < x < 0.23 range, 
variations in T g(x) and  ΔHnr(x) show a mild glitch ( Fig.1a ) and a satellite window 
(Fig.1b ) respectively.  Raman scattering on glasses excited in the IR ( 1.06 μm ) were 
performed in a back scattering geometry  us ing a Nicolet FT Raman module with  model 
870 FTIR bench at 1 cm-1 resolution.  Fourteen bands were  identified and their strengths 
traced as functions of compositi on in order to monitor the natu re of the molecular clusters 
and the degree of nanoscale phase separa tion. This allows the identification ( Fig. 2a ) of 
P- centered15-18 pyramidal (PYR) and quasi-tetra hedral (QT) , and Ge-centered5,19,20  
 5
5corner-sharing (CS) and edge-sharing (ES) units  from their vibrational modes. The nature 
of P-centered units is inde pendently confirmed from P31  NMR results21. These 
considerations lead to the construction of a full ternary phase diagram showing the 
regimes of the three generic elastic phases obs erved near the stiffness transition in these 
alloys; details will be published elsewhere. Mo lar volumes of the glasses in the fresh and 
aged state were measured ( Fig.3 ) using Archimedis method. 
  The central result of the present work  is the observation of a deep and wide reversibility 
window  in the 0.09 < x < 0.145 (or 2.27 < r < 2.44) range. The window delineates the 
three elastic phases ; floppy  at r < 2.27, intermediate  in the 2.27 < r < 2.44 range, and 
stressed rigid  at r > 2.44. Here r = 2 +3x (ref.2). The reversibility window sharpens  and 
gets deeper  as glass compositions outside the window  age at 300K (Fig. 1b).  Floppy 
glasses (below the window) age ove r a 3-month waiting period, while stressed-rigid  
glasses (above the window) age somewhat slow er ~ 5-months. The slower aging kinetics 
of the latter phase is probably  connected with their higher T
gs. There is no evidence of 
aging for glasses in the reversibility window  even after a 5 - month waiting period.  
 In the reversibility window composition range the local structures ar e thought to consist 
of  CS ( r = 2.40-2.67) and ES ( r = 2.67) Ge(Se
1/2)4 tetrahedra, pyramidal ( r = 2.40) 
P(Se 1/2)3 and quasi-tetrahedral (  r = 2.28) Se=P(Se 1/2)3 units. These structural units all 
have the feature2 that the number of Lagrangian c onstraints/atom due to bond-stretching 
and bond-bending forces equals 3, the degrees of freedom/atom according to which they 
comprise isostatic rigidity7,8. The exceptional thermal and el astic behavior of glasses in  
 6
6the reversibility window  derives from the isostatically rigid nature of their backbones. 
From theoretical considerations it is plausible that the bac kbones of these alloys can be 
made up entirely of such isosta tic units over the range of the reversibility window2,3,5,9,22.  
Thus, for example, the window begins near r = 2.28 where the concentration of QT unit 
(r = 2.28) maximizes21 (Fig.2b ), and the window ends near r = 2.44 where concentrations 
of PYR units ( r = 2.40), CS ( r = 2.40-2.67) and ES units ( r = 2.67) is high ( Fig.2a ). 
Furthermore, one would expect molecular pack ing of these units as manifested in molar 
volumes of the glasses to show absence of  aging effects as is indeed observed ( Fig. 3 )   
for window compositions. In the latter, molar volumes are found to be nearly independent 
of coordination number.              In conclusion, MDSC and Raman scattering on P
xGexSe1-2x glasses have permitted 
isolation of the reversibility window  and analysis of its aver age and local structures.  One 
of the popular  qualitative descriptions of  glasses describes the temperature dependence of 
the viscosity of a supercooled melt in terms of whether it exhibits a constant Arrhenius 
activation energy, or whether this  energy increases as the melt is supercooled; the former 
materials are said to form strong glasses, the latt er fragile ones23.  In As-Se binary glasses 
we have already pointed out that the reversibility window coincides with a window in 
activation energies for viscosity relaxation3. The essential new f eature here is the 
evidence that for the same composition range th ere does not seem to be structural aging 
in sharp contrast to the behavior encountered  for fragile glass compositions outside this 
window.

7The close correspondence between reversible melting and aging  near the stiffness 
transition of the network backbone are most  suggestive for the analogy with protein 
folding which has been postulated in recent skeletal models13 of living polypeptide chains.  
There it was shown that 26 di verse proteins undergo a mech anical stiffness transition 
very similar to that in singly bonded networ k glasses near the same average coordination 
number (< r> = 2.41) found in the glasses13.  Noteworthy  also are the  DSC results24 on a 
variety of proteins (large ones such as Lys- plasminogen that have several loops or single 
domain proteins such as egg- white lysozyme ) that show th e denaturation process to be 
thermally reversible . Repetitive calorimetric scans24 taken across the fo lding transition(s) 
in each instance are found to be almost indi stinguishable from each other.  Of course, 
protein functionality demands that there be almost no aging and nearly complete reversibility during the life of  the protein. It is in this respect the present finding of a 
reversibility window  in glasses bears a close an alogy to protein folding.   
 The width of the windows may be determined by the strengths of residual interactions 
relative to the covalent constraints. The narrow width of the protein window Δr = ± 0.02, 
compared to < r> = 2.36 and Δr = ± 0.08 for the glasses studied here, indicates a much 
more sophisticated degree of self-organization achiev ed in proteins by evolutionary 
design. In glasses these residual fluctuations may be the external covalent bonds between 
P-pyramids and Ge-tetrahedra, while in the pr oteins the important re sidual interactions 
involve weak H bonds
13.  Note that a very na rrow window centered at r = 2.34 of width 
Δr = ± 0.0025 has been observed in Ge-S-I glasses;  this width may reflect the weakness 
of non-bonded I-I van der Waals interactions25.  Here we have shown that the conditions  
 8
8for formation of reversible f unctionality in glasses and prot eins are similarly distinctive 
and can be characterized by the mechanical properties of their elastic backbones. We
