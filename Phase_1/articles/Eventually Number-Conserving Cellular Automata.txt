1 Introduction
Whereas cellular automata have been widely used to model complex sy s-
tems in which the local character of the evolution rule plays an essen tial
role [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the theory of cellular automata is still in its infancy a nd
very few exact results—as, for example, the necessary and suﬃc ient condi-
tion for a cellular automaton rule, either deterministic or probabilistic , to be
number-conserving— have been obtained [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] Recen tly most
1of the theoretical research carried out into this ﬁeld is devoted to deﬁnition
and characterization of new families of rules. In order to extend th e fam-
ily of number-conserving rules a number of papers on monotone rule s (the
set of number-conserving rules is a subset of monotone rules) hav e been pub-
lished [12]. The complexity of problems concerning characterizations of these
properties may be illustrated by a recent result [13] showing that m onotony
is decidable in dimension one but not in higher dimensions. This paper is
devoted to the study of a new class of cellular automata called eventually
number-conserving cellular automata deﬁned by the property of evolving af-
ter a ﬁnite number of time steps to states whose number of active s ites re-
mains constant. The characterization of this new class of cellular au tomata
is challenging since both number-conserving and monotone rules are special
cases of eventually number-conserving rules, and it is not, theref ore, obvious
that eventual number conservation is a decidable property.
A one-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) is a discrete dynamical sy s-
tem, which may be deﬁned as follows. Let s:Z×N/mapsto→ Qbe a function
satisfying the equation
s(i,t+1) =f/parenleftbig
s(i−rℓ,t),s(i−rℓ+1,t),...,s(i+rr,t)/parenrightbig
,(1)
for alli∈Zand allt∈NwhereZdenotes the set of all integers, Nthe
set of nonnegative integers, and Qa ﬁnite set of states, usually equal to
{0,1,2,...,q−1}.s(i,t) represents the state of site iat timet, and the
mapping f:Qrℓ+rr+1→ Qis thelocal CA evolution rule . The positive
integersrℓandrrare, respectively, the leftandright radii of the rule. In
what follows, fwill be referred to as an n-input rule , wherenis the number
rℓ+rr+1 of arguments of f. Any map c:ZL/mapsto→ Qis called a conﬁguration .
Following Wolfram [14], to each rule fwe assign a code number N(f) such
that
N(f) =/summationdisplay
(x1,x2,...,xn)∈Qnf(x1,x2,...,x n)qqn−1x1+qn−2x2+···+q0xn.
Two-state, three-input cellular automata (CAs) are referred to aselementary
CAs.
In this paper, we will only consider ﬁnite (or periodic) CAs, and replac e
the setZby the set ZLof integers modulo L. Any element of the set QLwill
be called a cyclic conﬁguration of length L.

for all cyclic conﬁgurations of length L≥n, it satisﬁes
f(x1,x2,...,x n−1,xn)+f(x2,x3,...,x n,xn+1)+···
+f(xL,x1...,xn−2,xn−1) =x1+x2+···+xL.(2)
It can be shown [7] that:
A one-dimensional q-staten-input CA rule fis number-conserving if,
and only if, for all (x1,x2,...,x n)∈ Qn, it satisﬁes
f(x1,x2,...,x n) =x1+n−1/summationdisplay

The purpose of this paper is to study eventually number-conserving CA
rules. This new class of CA rules, which is an extension of the class of
number-conserving CA rules, is deﬁned as follows:
A one-dimensional q-staten-input CA rule fiseventually number-con-
serving(ENC) if, after a ﬁnitenumber of iterations of rule f, it satisﬁes
condition (2) for all cyclic conﬁgurations of length L≥n.
While number-conserving CAs may be viewed as models of isolated sys-
tems of interacting particles in which processes of annihilation or cre ation of
particles are forbidden, ENC CAs are models of open systems of inte racting
particles exchanging particles with the external world such that at after a
ﬁnite transient time the numbers of particles moving from and to the sys-
tem exactly counterbalance each other. Numerical simulations sho w that the
constant number of active sites in conﬁgurations of the limit set of a n ENC
CA depend not only upon the initial number of active sites but also on t he
detailed structure of the initial conﬁguration.
In the two following sections we consider classes of CAs that one migh t
think coincide with ENC CAs. In the last section the motion representation
of CA rules is introduced. More explicitly than the usual rule table, it s hows
how to represent particle motion either inside the system or betwee n the
system and the external world, stressing the fact that ENC CAs c an be
viewed as systems of interacting particles.
32 Monotone CA rules
A one-dimensional q-staten-input CA rule fisnumber-nondecreasing if,
for all cyclic conﬁgurations of length L≥n, it satisﬁes
f(x1,x2,...,x n−1,xn)+f(x2,x3,...,x n,xn+1)+···
+f(xL,x1...,xn−2,xn−1)≥x1+x2+···+xL.(4)
Theq-staten-input CA rule C(f), deﬁned by
C(f)(x1,x2,...,x n) =f(q−1−x1,q−1−x2,...,q−1−xn),
is called the conjugate of rulef. This deﬁnition implies that the conjugate
of a number-nondecreasing CA rule fisnumber-nonincreasing , that is, for
all cyclic conﬁgurations of length L≥n, it satisﬁes
f(x1,x2,...,x n−1,xn)+f(x2,x3,...,x n,xn+1)+···
+f(xL,x1...,xn−2,xn−1)≤x1+x2+···+xL.(5)
A CA rule is monotone if it is either number-nondecreasing or number-
nonincreasing. SomepropertiesofmonotoneCAshave beendiscus sed in[12].
If a CA rule is number-nondecreasing andnumber-nonincreasing , it is
number-conserving . The class of number-conserving rules is therefore a sub-
class of the class of monotone rules.
It isclear thatall monotonerules areENC, but have wea theoremst ating
a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a CA rule fto be monotone? The
answer is “yes.” It can be shown [15], that1
A one-dimensional q-staten-input CA rule fisnumber-nondecreasing
(resp.number-nonincreasing ) if, for all cyclic conﬁgurations of lengths 2n−2
and 2n−1it satisﬁes relation (4) (resp. (5)) .
Remark. The word andis essential since the CA rules that verify (4) or
(5) for all cyclic conﬁgurations of either length 2 n−2 or 2n−1 are not
necessarily monotone. To be monotone, say nondecreasing, a rule has to
verify relation (4) for all conﬁgurations of lengths 2 n−2 and 2n−1. This
is, in particular, the case for three-state two-input CA rules. The sets of
rules that satisfy relation (4) for all cyclic conﬁgurations of length s 2 and 3
1Another, less practical, necessary and suﬃcient condition can be f ound in [12].
4have, respectively, 864 and 724 elements while the intersection of t hese two
sets contains only 708 CA rules which are the only monotone nondecr easing
rules.
There exist 87 monotone elementary CA rules. The sets of nonincre asing
and nondecreasing elementary CA rules both contain 46 rules. The in tersec-
tion of these two sets consists of the ﬁve number-conserving elem entary CA
rules.2
Although all monotone rules are ENC rules, are all ENC rules monoton e?
The answer is “no.” In other words, the class of monotone rules is strictly
included in the class of ENC rules. For example, elementary CA rules 99 ,
173, and 229 are ENC but not monotone. They are deﬁned, respec tively, by
f99(0,0,0) = 1, f99(0,0,1) = 1, f99(0,1,0) = 0, f99(0,1,1) = 0,
f99(1,0,0) = 0, f99(1,0,1) = 1, f99(1,1,0) = 1, f99(1,1,1) = 0,
f173(0,0,0) = 1, f173(0,0,1) = 0, f173(0,1,0) = 1, f173(0,1,1) = 1,
f173(1,0,0) = 0, f173(1,0,1) = 1, f173(1,1,0) = 0, f173(1,1,1) = 1,
and
f229(0,0,0) = 1, f229(0,0,1) = 0, f229(0,1,0) = 1, f229(0,1,1) = 0,
f229(1,0,0) = 0, f229(1,0,1) = 1, f229(1,1,0) = 1, f229(1,1,1) = 1.
3 Emulating number-conserving rules
A CA rule femulates rule gif, for all ﬁnite conﬁguration of length Lbe-
longing to the limit set Λfof rulef, its images by either forgare equal.
That is, for all c∈Λfand alli∈ZL,
g/parenleftbig
c(i−rℓ),c(i−rℓ+1),...,c(i+rr)/parenrightbig
=f/parenleftbig
c(i−rℓ),c(i−rℓ+1),...,c(i+rr)/parenrightbig
.
Itwouldbetemptingtodeﬁne aENCCAruleasaCArulethatemulates,
at least, one number-conserving rule. Here are two examples.
2See the appendix for a complete list.
5Example 1. Elementary CA rule 176, deﬁned by
f176(0,0,0) = 0, f176(0,0,1) = 0, f176(0,1,0) = 0, f176(0,1,1) = 0,
f176(1,0,0) = 1, f176(1,0,1) = 1, f176(1,1,0) = 0, f176(1,1,1) = 1,
is number-nonincreasing. One can readily verify that it emulates num ber-
conserving elementary CA rules 184 and 240 (see top ﬁgure 1). Con ﬁgura-
tions belonging to its limit set consist of isolated 1s separated by sequ ences
of 0s whose lengths depend upon the initial conﬁguration.
Example 2. Elementary CA rule 99 deﬁned above, which is not monotone,
emulates elementary CA rule 226. Conﬁgurations of its limit set consis t of
alternating sequences of 0s and 1s with, depending upon the initial c onﬁgu-
ration, either a few pairs of 0s, separating two successive 1s, or a few pairs
of 1s, separating two successive 0s (see bottom ﬁgure 1).
Figure 1: The spatiotemporal patterns of elementary CA rules 176 (top ) and
99 (bottom) show clearly that these rules emulate, respecti vely, elementary
CA rules 184 and 240, and elementary rules 226.
In Appendix 2 we show how to determine ENC CA rules emulating
number-conserving rules.
Are there ENC CA rules that do not emulate a number-conserving ru le?
Surprisingly, the answer is “yes,” and deﬁning ENC CA rules as rules, w hich
after a ﬁnite number of iterations emulate number-conserving rule s would be
6inadequate. As for monotone rules, the set of rules that emulate a number-
conserving rules is strictlyincluded in the set of ENC rules. For example,
elementary CA rules 74 and 88, obtained by reﬂection3of rule 74, are exam-
ples of such rules. They are deﬁned by
f74(0,0,0) = 0, f74(0,0,1) = 1, f74(0,1,0) = 0, f74(0,1,1) = 1,
f74(1,0,0) = 0, f74(1,0,1) = 0, f74(1,1,0) = 1, f74(1,1,1) = 0,
and
f88(0,0,0) = 0, f88(0,0,1) = 0, f88(0,1,0) = 0, f88(0,1,1) = 1,
f88(1,0,0) = 1, f88(1,0,1) = 0, f88(1,1,0) = 1, f88(1,1,1) = 0,
They are not monotone and do not emulate number-conserving rule s. Actu-
ally, conﬁgurations belonging to their limit sets contains all the 8 diﬀer ent
triplets. Both spatiotemporal patterns exhibit the propagation in opposite
directions of similar structures (see ﬁgure 2). Rules 173 and 229, d eﬁned
above, and that are respectively conjugate of rules 74 and 88, do not emulate
number-conserving rules and have spatiotemporal patterns tha t, like rules 74
and 88, exhibit the propagation in opposite directions of similar struc tures.
Since there exist ENC rules that are not monotone and do not emulat e
any number-conserving one, the union of the set of monotone rule s and the
set of rules emulating number-conserving rules is strictlyincluded in the set
of ENC rules.
4 Motion representation
The particle dynamics is not clearly exhibited by the CA rule table. A
simpler and more visual picture of the evolution rule can be given by its
motion representation . This representation, which has been ﬁrst introduced
for number-conserving rules [6], was deﬁned as follows. List all the neigh-
borhoods of an occupied site represented by its site value s∈ Q. Then, for
each neighborhood, indicate the displacements of the sparticles by arrow(s)
3Theq-staten-input CA rule R(f), deﬁned by
R(f)(x1,x2,...,x n) =f(xn,xn−1,...,x 1),
is called the reﬂected of rulef.
7Figure 2: Spatiotemporal patterns of elementary CA rules 74 (top) and
88 (bottom). Both rules—one being the reﬂected rule of the ot her—are not
monotone and do not emulate number-conservative rules. Ini tial conﬁgura-
tions are random.
joining the site where the particle(s) is (are) initially located to its (th eir)
ﬁnal position(s). A number above the arrow indicates how many par ticles
are moving to the ﬁnal position. To simplify the representation only n eigh-
borhoods for which, at least one particle is moving. are listed. Here a re two
examples. The motion representation of the two-state three-inp ut rule 184,
which represents the simplest car moving rule on a one-lane highway, is
1/archrightdown
10.
Since a particle located on the left of an occupied site cannot move to the
right (which the direction of motion) we do not mention it. In a less com pact
notation we could complete the above representation with
/anticlockwise
11.
The motion representation of the three-state three-input rule 6 171534259461
is
1/archrightdown
101/archrightdown
112/archrightdown
201/archrightdown
21
8In both examples particles move only to the right. It is, therefore, not nec-
essary to indicate the state of the left neighboring site of the part icle(s).
It is rather straightforward to extend this representation to no nconserva-
tive rules. The only diﬀerence with number-conserving rules is to indic ate
the possibility of creations and annihilations of particles. This is done b y
adding either a + or a −sign above the site state followed by a positive
numbernto represent, respectively, creation and annihilation of nparticles
at that site. Although the number of particles is not conserved, we shall keep
the name motion representation , since creations and annihilations of parti-
cles may be viewed as particles moving between the system and the ex ternal
world. Here are two examples illustrating that ENC CAs rules can be vie wed
as evolving systems of particles and not just ﬁnite sequences of no nnegative
integers obeying abstract transformation rules.
Example 1. The motion of particles in a system evolving according to CA
rule 176 is represented by4
1/archrightdown
10•,0−1
1•,
where the symbol •may represent either a 0 or a 1. The second term shows
that only isolated 1s can survive, as illustrated in top ﬁgure 1. In add ition,
when no more particles can be annihilated, that is, when all particles h ave
empty neighboring sites, the evolution rule of the system coincides w ith CA
rules 184 and 240, in agreement with the fact that rule 176 emulates these
two rules.
Example 2. The evolution of a system of particles evolving according to
CA rule 74 is represented by
01/archleftdown
01,0−1
10,1−1
11.
The ﬁrst term shows that isolated 1s move to the left (see top ﬁgur e 2),
furthermore, starting from a triplet of 1s in a sea of 0s, the combin ation
of these three terms generates t a composite particle of length 6 o scillating
between two states: 001110 and 011010 propagating to the left, or the two-
row composite particle
001110
011010
4A systematic determination of motion representations is given in [15].
9which, then propagates to the left. Note that the motion represe ntation lists
only neighborhoods of moving particles, where “moving” stands for motion
to or from the external world.
5 Conclusion
We have introduced a new class of CAs called eventually number-conserving
(ENC) CAs adopting the following deﬁnition: A one-dimensional q-staten-
input CA rule fiseventually number-conserving if, after a ﬁnitenumber
of iterations, it satisﬁes the number-conserving conditio n (2) for all cyclic
conﬁgurations of length L≥n. ENC CAs are models of open systems of
interacting particles exchanging particles with the external world b ut that,
after a ﬁnite transient time, the numbers of particles moving from a nd to
the system exactly counterbalance each other. The interpretat ion in terms
of particles is emphasized by the motion representation of the CA ev olution
rule. We have shown that the set of ENC CA rules strictlyincludes the
set of number-conserving rules, the set of monotone rules, and t he set of
rules emulating a number-conserving rule. The set of ENC rules also s trictly
includes the union of all these sets showing that the set of ENC rules actually
contains rules which do not belong to any of these sets. This challeng ing
result suggests that the characterization of this new apparently simple class
is probably not a trivial problem.

tion of these two sets. Their code numbers are: {170,184,204,226,240}.
Appendix 2
In this appendix we show how to ﬁnd examples of ENC CA rules emulating
given number-conserving CA rules.
Four-input rule 50358 is number-conserving. It is deﬁned by
f50358(0,0,0,0) = 0, f50358(0,0,0,1) = 1, f50358(0,0,1,0) = 1,
f50358(0,0,1,1) = 0, f50358(0,1,0,0) = 1, f50358(0,1,0,1) = 1,
f50358(0,1,1,0) = 0, f50358(0,1,1,1) = 1, f50358(1,0,0,0) = 0,
f50358(1,0,0,1) = 0, f50358(1,0,1,0) = 1, f50358(1,0,1,1) = 0,
f50358(1,1,0,0) = 0, f50358(1,1,0,1) = 0, f50358(1,1,1,0) = 1,
f50358(1,1,1,1) = 1.

11Among the 16 diﬀerent quadruplets of 0s and 1s, the limit set of rule 5 0358
contains only the following ones:
(0,0,0,0),(0,0,0,1),(0,0,1,0),(0,0,1,1),(0,1,0,1),
(0,1,1,0),(0,1,1,1),(1,0,0,0),(1,0,1,1),(1,1,0,0),
(1,1,1,0).
Among all the four-input rules having the same images as rule 50358 f or all
these 11 quadruplets one can verify that only rules 16566, 49334, and 50870
are ENC and have the same limit set as rule 50358. These three rules a re
