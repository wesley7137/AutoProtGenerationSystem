Title: Isolation and Characterization of Extracellular Vesicles to Activate Retina Regeneration.
Abstract: Mammals do not possess the ability to spontaneously repair or regenerate damaged retinal tissue. In contrast to teleost fish which are capable of retina regeneration through the action of Müller glia, mammals undergo a process of reactive gliosis and scarring that inhibits replacement of lost neurons. Thus, it is important to discover novel methods for stimulating mammalian Müller glia to dedifferentiate and produce progenitor cells that can replace lost retinal neurons. Inducing an endogenous regenerative pathway mediated by Müller glia would provide an attractive alternative to stem cell injections or gene therapy approaches. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are now recognized to serve as a novel form of cell-cell communication through the transfer of cargo from donor to recipient cells or by the activation of signaling cascades in recipient cells. EVs have been shown to promote proliferation and regeneration raising the possibility that delivery of EVs could be a viable treatment for visual disorders. Here, we provide protocols to isolate EVs for use in retina regeneration experiments.
