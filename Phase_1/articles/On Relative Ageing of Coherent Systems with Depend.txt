Further, we investigate whether the active redundancy at the component level is
more effective than that at the system level with respect to ageing faster

1 Introduction and Preliminaries
Ageing is a common phenomenon experienced by both living org anisms and mechanical sys-
tems. It largely describes how a system/living organism imp roves or deteriorates with age. The
study of stochastic ageing has receieved considerable atte ntion from researchers in the last few
decades. In the literature, many diﬀerent types of stochasti c ageing concepts (e.g., increasing
failure rate (IFR), increasing failure rate in average (IFR A), etc.) have been developed to de-
scribe diﬀerent ageing characteristics of a system. There ar e three types of ageings, namely,
∗Corresponding author, email: nkhazra@iiitdm.ac.in
1positive ageing, negative ageing and no ageing. A brief disc ussion on diﬀerent ageing concepts
could be found in Barlow and Proschan [4], and Lai and Xie [31] . Similar to these ageing
concepts, there is another useful notion of ageing, called r elative ageing, which describes how a
system ages relative to another one.
Theproportionalhazard(PH)ratemodel,commonlyknownasC ox’sPHmodel(seeCox[10]),
iswidelyusedtoanalyzethefailuretimedatainreliabilit y andsurvivalanalysis. Later, diﬀerent
other models were introduced, namely, proportional mean re sidual lifetime model, proportional
reversed hazard rate model, proportional odds model, etc (s ee Marshall and Olkin [35], Lai
and Xie [31], and Finkelstein [18]). In many real life scenar ios, the phenomenon of crossing
hazards/mean residual lives has been observed (see Pocock e t al. [50], Champlin et al. [9], and
Mantel and Stablein [34]). To handle this crossing hazard ra tes problem, Kalashnikov and
Rachev [26] introduced a stochastic order (called ageing fa ster order in the hazard rate) based
on the concept of relative ageing. Indeed, this approach cou ld be considered as a reasonable
alternative to the PH model. A detailed study of this order is done by Sengupta and Desh-
pande [54]. In addition, they have also introduced two other similar kinds of stochastic orders.
Later, Finkelstein [17] proposed a stochastic order, based on mean residual lifetime functions,
that describes the relative ageings of two life distributio ns, whereas Rezaei [52] introduced a
similar stochastic order in terms of the reversed hazard rat e functions. Some generalized order-
ings in this direction were proposed by Hazra and Nanda [25].
The basic structures of most of the real life systems match wi th the so called coherent sys-
tem. A system is called coherent if its all components are rel evant and its structure function
(see Barlow and Proschan [4] for the deﬁnition) is monotonic ally non-decreasing with respect
to each argument (which means that an improvement in perform ance of a component cannot
decrease the lifetime of the system). The well known k-out-of-nsystem is a special case of
coherent systems. A system of ncomponents is said to be k-out-of-nsystem if it functions as
long as at least kof itsncomponents function. Two extreme cases of a k-out-of-nsystem are
1-out-of-nsystem (called parallel system) and n-out-of-nsystem (called series system). Further,
there is an one-to-one correspondence between a k-out-of-nsystem and an ( n−k+1)-th order
statistic (of lifetimes of ncomponents). Thus, the study of a k-out-of-nsystem is essentially
the same as the study of an order statistic.
Stochastic comparisons of coherent systems is considered a s one of the important problems
in reliability theory. The list of results, so far developed , on various stochastic comparisons of
k-out-of-nsystems with independent components could be found in Pledg er and Proschan [49],
Proschan and Sethuraman [51], Balakrishnan and Zhao [3], Ha zra et al. [21], and the references
therein. Further, stochastic comparisons of general coher ent systems were considered in Esary
and Proschan [16], Nanda et al. [42], Kochar et al. [29], Belz unce et al. [7], Navarro and Ru-
bio [47], Navarro et al. [43, 44, 46], Samaniego and Navarro [ 53], Amini-Seresht et al. [1], to
name a few. Note that all these results are developed using di ﬀerent stochastic orders, namely,
usual stochastic order, hazard rate order, likelihood rati o order, etc. However, the study of co-
2herent systems using ageing faster orders are not substanti ally done yet. Misra and Francis [37],
Li and Lu [32], and Ding and Zhang [15] developed some results fork-out-of-nsystems using
ageing faster orders. Later, Ding et al. [14] have given some suﬃcient conditions in terms of
signatureto compare thelifetimes of two coherent systems ( with independentcomponents) with
respect to ageing faster orders. However, there is no such re sult where the suﬃcient conditions
are given in terms of reliability functions. Furthermore, t he coherent systems with dependent
components are also not considered yet. Thus, one of our majo r goals of this paper is to provide
some suﬃcient conditions (in terms of reliability function s) under which one coherent system
dominates another one with respect to ageing faster orders.
One of the eﬀective ways to enhance the lifetime of a system is b y incorporating spares (or
redundant components) into the system. Then the key questio n is−how to allocate spares
into the system so that the system’s lifetime will be optimum in some stochastic sense? In
Barlow and Proschan [4], it is shown that the allocation of ac tive redundancy at the component
level (of a coherent system) is superior to that at the system level with respect to the usual
stochastic order. Later, many other researchers have studi ed this problem in diﬀerent directions
(see Boland and El-Neweihi [6], Misra et al. [36], Nanda and H azra [40], Hazra and Nanda [22],
Zhao et al. [57], Da and Ding [11], Zhang et al. [56], and the re ferences therein). However, to
the best of our knowledge, this problem using ageing faster o rders is not studied yet. Thus,
another goal of this paper is to derive some necessary and suﬃ cient conditions under which the
lifetime of a coherent system with active redundancy at the c omponent level is larger (smaller)
than that at the system level with respect to ageing faster or ders.
The real life systems are either formed by new components or b y used components. Consider
two coherent systems, namely, a used coherent system (i.e., a coherent system formed by a set
of new components, and then the system has been used for some t imet >0) and a coherent
system of used components (i.e., a coherent system formed by a set of components which have
already been used for time t >0). It is a fact that a coherent system of new components
does not always have larger lifetime than a coherent system m ade out of used components (see
Navarro et al. [45]). Similarly, a used coherent system may o r may not perform better than a
coherent system of used components. The stochastic compari sons between these two systems
have been done in numerous papers, see, for example, Li and Lu [33], Gupta [19], Gupta et
al. [20], Hazra and Nanda [24], to name a few. However, to the b est our knowledge, the ageing
faster orders have not yet been used, as a tool, to compare the se two systems. Thus, the study
of stochastic comparisons between a used coherent system an d a coherent system of used com-
ponents is another thrust area that is to be focused here.
In what follows, we introduce some notation that will be used throughout the paper. For a
random variable W(with absolutely continuous cumulative distribution func tion), we denote
its probability density function (pdf) by fW(·), the cumulative distribution function (cdf) by
FW(·), the hazard rate function by rW(·), the reversed hazard rate function by ˜ rW(·) and the
survival/reliability function by ¯FW(·);¯FW(·) = 1−FW(·).
3Let us consider a coherent system with lifetime τ(X) formed by ncomponents having de-
pendent and identically distributed (d.i.d.) lifetime vec torX= (X1,X2,...,X n), where Xi’s
are identically distributed, say Xid=X, i= 1,2,...,n, for some non-negative random variable
X; hered= means equality in distribution. Then the joint reliabilit y function of Xis given by
¯FX(x1,x2,...,x n) =P(X1> x1,X2> x2,...,X n> xn)
=K/parenleftbig¯FX(x1),¯FX(x2),...,¯FX(xn)/parenrightbig
,
whereK(·,·,...,·) is a survival copula describing the dependency structure a mong compo-
nents of the system. Indeed, this representation is well kno wn through Sklar’s Theorem (see
Nelsen [48]). In the literature, many diﬀerent types of survi val copulas have been studied in
order to describe diﬀerent dependency structures among comp onents. Some of the widely used
copulas are Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula, Arch imedean copula with diﬀerent gen-
erators, Clayton-Oakes (CO) copula, etc. We refer the reade r to Nelsen [48] for a detailed dis-
cussionon thecopulatheory, andits various applications. Inwhat follows, wegive alemmathat
describes a fundamental bridge between a system and its corr esponding components through
the domination function.
Lemma 1.1 (Navarro et al. [43]) Letτ(X)be the lifetime of a coherent system formed by n
d.i.d. components with the lifetime vector X= (X1,X2,...,X n). Then the reliability function
ofτ(X)can be written as
¯Fτ(X)(x) =h/parenleftbig¯FX(x)/parenrightbig
,
whereh(·) : [0,1]→[0,1], called the domination (or dual distortion) function, depe nds on the
structure function φ(·)(see Barlow and Proschan [4] for deﬁnition) and on the surviv al copula
KofX1,X2,...,X n. Furthermore, h(·)is an increasing continuous function in [0,1]such that
h(0) = 0andh(1) = 1. ✷
Below we give an example (borrowed from Navarro et al. [43]) t hat illustrates the result
given in the above lemma.
Example 1.1 Letτ(X) = min{X1,max{X2,X3}}, whereX= (X1,X2,X3)is described by
the FGM Copula (see Nelsen [48])
K(p1,p2,p3) =p1p2p3(1+θ(1−p1)(1−p2)(1−p3)),forpi∈(0,1), i= 1,2,3,andθ∈[−1,1].
Further, let X1,X2andX3be identically distributed with a random variable X. Then the mini-
mal path sets (see Barlow and Proschan [4]) of τ(X)are given by {1,2}and{1,3}. LetX{1,2},
X{1,3}andX{1,2,3}be the lifetimes of the path sets {1,2},{1,3}and{1,2,3}, respectively. Then
4the reliability function of τ(X)can be written as
¯Fτ(X)(x) =P/parenleftbig
{X{1,2}> x}∪{X{1,3}> x}/parenrightbig
=P/parenleftbig
X{1,2}> x)+P(X{1,3}> x/parenrightbig
−P(X{1,2,3}> x)
=¯FX(x,x,0)+¯FX(x,0,x)−¯FX(x,x,x)
=K/parenleftbig¯FX(x),¯FX(x),1/parenrightbig
+K/parenleftbig¯FX(x),1,¯FX(x)/parenrightbig
−K/parenleftbig¯FX(x),¯FX(x),¯FX(x)/parenrightbig
=h/parenleftbig¯FX(x)/parenrightbig
,
where
h(p) =K(p,p,1)+K(p,1,p)−K(p,p,p)
= 2p2−p3−θp3(1−p)3,forp∈(0,1)andθ∈[−1,1].
Stochasticordersarecommonlyusedtocomparetworandomva riables(ortwosetsofrandom
variables), and have been extensively studied in the litera ture due to their various applications
in diﬀerent branches of science and engineering. An encyclop edic information on this topic is
nicely encapsulated in the book written by Shaked and Shanth ikumar [55] (also see Belzunce et
al. [8]). For the sake of completeness, we give the following deﬁnitions of the stochastic orders
that are used in our paper.
Deﬁnition 1.1 LetXandYbe two absolutely continuous random variables with cumulat ive
distribution functions FX(·)andFY(·), respectively, supported on [0,∞). ThenXis said to be
smaller than Yin
(a)hazard rate (hr) order, denoted as X≤hrY, if
¯FY(x)/¯FX(x)is increasing in x∈[0,∞);
(b)reversed hazard rate (rhr) order, denoted as X≤rhrY, if
FY(x)/FX(x)is increasing in x∈[0,∞).
Similar to the above discussed stochastic orders, there are two more sets of stochastic orders
which are useful to describe the relative ageings of two syst ems. The ﬁrst set of stochastic
orders, known as transform orders (namely, convex transfor m order, quantile mean inactivity
time order, star-shaped order, super-additive order, DMRL order, s-IFR order, etc.), describes
whether a system is ageing faster than another one in terms of the increasing failure rate, the
increasing failure rate on average, the new better than used , etc. A detailed discussion on these
orderscould befoundin Barlow and Proschan[4], Bartoszewi cz [5], DeshpandeandKochar[13],
Kochar and Wiens [30], Arriaza et al. [2], Nanda et al. [41], a nd the refernces therein. The
second set of stochastic orders, called ageing faster order s, is deﬁned based on monotonocity of
5ratios of some reliability measures, namely, hazard rate fu nction, reversed hazard rate function,
mean residual lifetime function, etc. For motivation and us efulness of these orders, we refer
the reader to Kalashnikov and Rachev [26], Sengupta and Desh pande [54], Di Crescenzo [12],
Finkelstein [17], Razaei et al. [52], Hazra and Nanda [25], M isra et al. [39], Kayid et al. [28],
and Misra and Francis [38]. Below we give the deﬁnitions of th e ageing faster orders that are
used in our paper.
Deﬁnition 1.2 LetXandYbe two absolutely continuous random variables with failure rate
functions rX(·)andrY(·), respectively, and reversed failure rate functions ˜rX(·)and˜rY(·),
respectively. Then Xis said to be ageing faster than Yin
(a)failure rate, denoted as X≺
cY, if
rX(x)/rY(x)is increasing in x∈[0,∞);
(b)reversed failure rate, denoted as X≺
bY, if
˜rX(x)/˜rY(x)is decreasing in x∈[0,∞).
The theory of totally positive functions has various applic ations in diﬀerent areas of proba-
bility and statistics (see Karlin [27]). Below we give the de ﬁnitions of TP 2and RR 2functions.
Diﬀerent properties of these functions are used in proving th e main results of our paper.
Deﬁnition 1.3 LetXandYbe two linearly ordered sets. Then, a real-valued function κ(·,·)
deﬁned on X ×Y, is said to be TP 2(resp. RR 2) if
κ(x1,y1)κ(x2,y2)≥(resp.≤)κ(x1,y2)κ(x2,y1),
for allx1< x2andy1< y2. ✷
Throughout the paper increasing and decreasing, as usual, m ean non-decreasing and non-
increasing, respectively. Similarly, positive and negati ve mean non-negative and non-positive,
respectively. Assume that all random variables considered in this paper are absolutely contin-
uous and non-negative (i.e., distributional support is [0 ,∞)). Byasgn=b, we mean that aandb
have the same sign, whereas adef.=bmeans that ais deﬁned as b. Further, we use bold symbols
to represent vectors, and the symbol Nis used to represent the set of natural numbers. We
writeτk|nandτl|mto represent the lifetimes of a k-out-of-nand al-out-of-msystems, respec-
tively. We use the acronyms i.i.d.andd.i.d.for ‘independent and identically distributed’ and
‘dependent and identically distributed’, respectively.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss some useful lemmas
which are intensively used in the proofs of the main results. In Section 3, we provide some
suﬃcient conditions under which the lifetime of one coheren t system is larger than that of an
6another system with respect to ageing faster orders in terms of the hazard and the reversed
hazard rates. In Section 4, we discuss a redundancy allocati on problem in a coherent system.
We derive some necessary and suﬃcient conditions under whic h the allocation of active redun-
dancy at the component level (of a coherent system) is superi or to that at the system level with
respect to ageing faster orders. Stochastic comparisons be tween a used coherent system and a
coherent system made by used components are discussed in Sec tion 5. The concluding remarks
are given in Section 6.
All proofs of lemmas and theorems, wherever given, are defer red to the Appendix.
2 Useful Lemmas
In this section we discuss some lemmas which will be used in pr oving the main results of this
paper. In the ﬁrst lemma we discuss the sign change property o f the integral of a function.
The following lemma is adopted from Karlin ([27], Theorem 11 .2, pp. 324-325), and Hazra and
Nanda ([23], Lemma 3.5).
Lemma 2.1 Letκ(x,y)>0, deﬁned on X × Y, be RR 2(resp. TP 2), where XandYare
subsets of the real line. Assume that a function f(·,·)deﬁned on X ×Yis such that
(i)for each x∈ X,f(x,y)changes sign at most once, and if the change of sign does occur ,
it is from positive to negative, as ytraverses Y;
(ii)for each y∈ Y,f(x,y)is increasing (resp. decreasing) in x∈ X;
(iii)ω(x) =/integraltext
Yκ(x,y)f(x,y)dµ(y)exists absolutely and deﬁnes a continuous function of x,
whereµis a sigma-ﬁnite measure.
Thenω(x)changes sign at most once, and if the change of sign does occur , it is from negative
(resp. positive) to positive (resp. negative), as xtraverses X. ✷
In the following lemma we state an equivalent condition of a m onotonic function. The proof
is straightforward, and hence omitted.
Lemma 2.2 Letf(·)andg(·)be two non-negative real-valued functions deﬁned on (a,b)⊆
(0,∞). Thenf(x)/g(x)is increasing (resp. decreasing) in x, if and only if for any real number
c, the diﬀerence f(x)−cg(x)changes sign at most once, and if the change of sign does occur ,
it is from negative (resp. positive) to positive (resp. nega tive), as xtraverses from atob.✷
Some properties of the reliability functions of a k-out-of-nand al-out-of-msystems are
discussed in the next two lemmas. Lemma 2.3 ( i) is obtained in Esary and Proschan [16],
whereas Lemma 2.4 ( i) is obtained in Nanda et al. [42]. The other proofs are deferr ed to the
Appendix.
7Lemma 2.3 Lethk|n(·)andhl|m(·)be the reliability functions of the k-out-of-nand thel-out-
of-msystems with i.i.d. components, respectively, where 1≤k≤nand1≤l≤m. Further,
letHk|n(p) =ph′
k|n(p)/hk|n(p)andHl|m(p) =ph′
l|m(p)/hl|m(p)for allp∈(0,1). Then the
following results hold.
(i)Hk|n(p)is decreasing in p∈(0,1);
(ii)Hk|n(p)/Hl|m(p)is decreasing in p∈(0,1), for allk≤landm−l≤n−k;
(iii) (1−p)H′
k|n(p)/Hk|n(p)is decreasing in p∈(0,1).
Lemma 2.4 Lethk|n(·)andhl|m(·)be the reliability functions of the k-out-of-nand thel-out-
of-msystems with i.i.d. components, respectively, where 1≤k≤nand1≤l≤m. Further,
letRk|n(p) = (1−p)h′
k|n(p)/(1−hk|n(p))andRl|m(p) = (1−p)h′
l|m(p)/(1−hl|m(p))for all
p∈(0,1). Then the following results hold.
(i)Rk|n(p)is increasing in p∈(0,1);
(ii)Rk|n(p)/Rl|m(p)is increasing in p∈(0,1), for alll≤kandn−k≤m−l;
(iii)pR′
k|n(p)/Rk|n(p)is decreasing in p∈(0,1).
3 Stochastic comparisons of two coherent systems
In this section we compare two coherent systems with respect to ageing faster orders in terms
of the failure and the reversed failure rates. We show that th e proposed results hold for the
k-out-of-nand thel-out-of-msystems with i.i.d. components.
Letτ1(X) andτ2(Y) (resp.τk|n(X) andτl|m(Y)) be the lifetimes of two coherent systems
(resp.k-out-of-nandl-out-of-msystems) formed by two diﬀerent sets of d.i.d. components
with the lifetime vectors X= (X1,X2,...,X n) andY= (Y1,Y2,...,Y m), respectively. For
the sake of simplicity of notation, let us assume that all Xi’s are identically distributed with
a non-negative random variable X, and all Yj’s are identically distributed with a non-negaive
random variable Y. Further, let h1(·) andh2(·) be the domination functions of τ1(X) and
τ2(Y), respectively. In what follows, we use the following notat ion. For p∈(0,1),
Hi(p) =ph′
i(p)
hi(p), i= 1,2,
and
Ri(p) =(1−p)h′
i(p)
1−hi(p), i= 1,2.
In the following theorem we show that under a set of suﬃcient c onditions τ1(X) is ageing
faster than τ2(Y) in terms of the failure rate.
Theorem 3.1 Suppose that the following conditions hold.
8(i)H1(p)andH1(p)/H2(p)are decreasing in p∈(0,1);
(ii) (1−p)H′
1(p)/H1(p)or(1−p)H′
2(p)/H2(p)is decreasing in p∈(0,1);
(iii)X≺
cYandY≤rhX.
Thenτ1(X)≺
cτ2(Y). ✷
Thefollowing corollary follows fromTheorem3.1 andLemma2 .3. Itisworthwile tomention
here that Theorem 3.1 (a) of Misra and Francis [37] is the part icular case of this corollary ( k=l
andm=n).
Corollary 3.1 Suppose that the Xi’s are i.i.d., and that the Yj’s are i.i.d. If X≺
cYand
Y≤rhX, thenτk|n(X)≺
cτl|m(Y)fork≤landm−l≤n−k.
Remark 3.1 Let the assumption of Corollary 3.1 hold. Then from Corollary 3. 1 we have
(i)τk|n(X)≺
cτl|n(Y)fork≤l;
(ii)τk|n(X)≺
cτk|m(Y)form≤n;
(iii)τl−r|m−r(X)≺
cτl|m(Y)forr≤l. ✷
One natural question may arise, which is whether the result s tated in Theorem 3.1 holds
without the condition Y≤rhX. Below we cite a counterexample which shows that this condi-
tion could not be relaxed.
Counterexample 3.1 Consider two coherent systems τ1(X) = max{X1,X2,X3}andτ2(Y) =
max{Y1,Y2,Y3}, whereXi’s are i.i.d. with the reliability function given by ¯FX(x) = exp{−2x3},
x >0, andYi’s are i.i.d. with the reliability function given by ¯FY(x) = exp{−0.1x2},x >0.
Then it could easily be veriﬁed that X≺
cYbutY/notlessequalrhX(In factY/notlessequalstX). Now, by writing
k(x) =rτ1(X)(x)/rτ2(Y)(x), we have
k(x) = 30xe−(2x3−0.1x2)

, x >0,
which is non-monotone over x >0, and hence τ1(X)⊀
cτ2(Y). ✷
In the following proposition we give a necessary and suﬃcien t condition for the case when
the lifetimes of the components of both coherent systems are identically distributed. The proof
follows in the same line as in Theorem 3.1, and hence omitted.
Proposition 3.1 LetXi’s be identically distributed. Then τ1(X)≺
c(resp.≻
c)τ2(X)if and
only if
H1(p)/H2(p)is decreasing (resp. increasing) in p∈(0,1).
9The following corollary, which is obtained in Theorem 2.1 of Misra and Francis [37], follows
from Proposition 3.1 and Lemma 2.3.
Corollary 3.2 Suppose that the Xi’s are i.i.d. Then τk|n(X)≺
cτl|m(X)fork≤landm−l≤
n−k.
Remark 3.2 Let the assumption of Corollary 3.2 hold. Then from Corollary 3. 2 we have
(i)τk|n(X)≺
cτl|n(X)fork≤l;
(ii)τk|n(X)≺
cτk|m(X)form≤n;
(iii)τl−r|m−r(X)≺
cτl|m(X)forr≤l. ✷
The following corollary given in Ding and Zhang [15] follows from Proposition 3.1. It shows
that a series system ages faster (in terms of the hazard rate) as its number of components
increases whereas the reverse scenario is observed for the p arallel system.
Corollary 3.3 Suppose that the Xi’s are d.i.d.components with the common Archimedean cop-
ula generated by φ(·). Ifxln′[−φ′(x)/(1−φ(x))]is decreasing in x >0, then
(i)τ1|n(X)≺
cτ1|m(X)form≤n;
(ii)τn|n(X)≺
cτm|m(X)forn≤m. ✷
Below we give an example that illustrates the result given in Proposition 3.1.
Example 3.1 Consider two coherent systems τ1(X) = min{X1,max{X2,X3}}andτ2(X) =
min{X1,X2,X3}which are formed by three identical components with lifetim esX1,X2andX3.
Further, let the joint distribution function of (X1,X2,X3)be described by the FGM copula
K(p1,p2,p3) =p1p2p3(1+θ(1−p1)(1−p2)(1−p3)),
wherepi∈(0,1),i= 1,2,3, andθ∈[−1,1]. Then the domination functions of τ1(X)and
τ2(X)are, respectively, given by
h1(p) = 2p2−p3−θp3(1−p)3,0< p <1
and
h2(p) =p3+θp3(1−p)3,0< p <1.
These give

Writing sθ(p) =H1(p)/H2(p), we have

(2p2−(1+θ)p3+3θp4−3θp5+θp6)(3(1+θ)p3−6θp6−12θp4+15θp5),0< p <1.
Now, consider the following two cases.
Case-I: Let θ=−.9,−.8,...,.4,.5. Then it can be veriﬁed that sθ(p) =H1(p)/H2(p)is decreas-
ing inp∈(0,1), and hence τ1(X)≺
cτ2(X)follows from Proposition 3.1.
Case-II: Let θ=.75,.80,...,.95,1. Then it can be checked that sθ(p) =H1(p)/H2(p)is non-
monotone over p∈(0,1). Hence, by Proposition 3.1, we get that neither τ1(X)≺
cτ2(X)nor
τ1(X)≻
cτ2(X)holds. ✷
In the following theorem we compare τ1(X) andτ2(Y) with respect to the ageing faster
order in the reversed hazard rate.
Theorem 3.2 Suppose that the following conditions hold.
(i)R1(p)andR1(p)/R2(p)are increasing in p∈(0,1);
(ii)pR′
1(p)/R1(p)orpR′
2(p)/R2(p)is decreasing in p∈(0,1);
(iii)X≺

Thenτ1(X)≺

The following corollary immediately follows from Theorem 3 .2 and Lemma 2.4. Note that
Theorem 3.1(b) of MisraandFrancis [37] is aparticular case of this corollary ( k=landm=n).
Corollary 3.4 Suppose that the Xi’s are i.i.d., and that the Yj’s are i.i.d. If X≺
bYand
X≤hrY, thenτk|n(X)≺
bτl|m(Y)forl≤kandn−k≤m−l.
Remark 3.3 Let the assumption of Corollary 3.4 hold. Then from Corollary 3. 4 we have
(i)τk|n(X)≺
bτl|n(Y)forl≤k;
(ii)τk|n(X)≺
bτk|m(Y)forn≤m;
(iii)τk|n(X)≺
bτk−r|n−r(Y)forr≤k. ✷
The following counterexample shows that the result given in Theorem 3.2 may not hold
without the condition X≤hrY.
11Counterexample 3.2 Consider the coherent systems τ1(X) = min {X1,X2}andτ2(Y) =
min{Y1,Y2}, whereXi’s are i.i.d. with the cumulative distribution function giv en byFX(x) =
exp{−(2.1/x)7},x >0, andYi’s are i.i.d. with the cumulative distribution function giv en by
FY(x) = exp{−(2/x)3},x >0. Then it is easy to verify that X≺

X/notlessequalstY). Now, by writing l(x) = ˜rτ2(Y)(x)/˜rτ1(X)(x), we have

which is non-monotone over x >0, and hence τ2|2(X)⊀

In the following proposition we discuss an analog of Proposi tion 3.1 for the ageing faster
order in the reversed hazard rate.
Proposition 3.2 LetXi’s be identically distributed. Then τ1(X)≺

Corollary 3.5 Suppose that the Xi’s are i.i.d. Then τk|n(X)≺

The following corollary obtained in Ding and Zhang [15] imme diately follows from Propo-
sition 3.2. It shows that a series system ages faster (in term s of the reversed hazard rate) as
its number of components decreases whereas the reverse scen ario is observed for the parallel
system.
Corollary 3.6 Suppose that the Xi’s are d.i.d. components with the common Archimedean
copula generated by φ(·). Ifxln′[−φ′(x)/φ(x)]is decreasing (resp. increasing) in x >0, then

(ii)τn|n(X)≻

12The result stated in Proposition 3.2 is revealed through the following example.
Example 3.2 Consider two coherent systems which are discussed in Example 3.1. Then
R1(p) =(1−p)h′

1−h1(p)=4p−(7+3θ)p2+3(1+5 θ)p3−27θp4+21θp5−6θp6

1−(1+θ)p3+θp6+3θp4−3θp5,0< p <1.
Writing vθ(p) =R2(p)/R1(p), we have
vθ(p) =3(1+θ)p2−3(1+5θ)p3+27θp4−21θp5+6θp6

Forθ=−1,−.8,...,.8,1, it can be veriﬁed that vθ(p)is increasing in p∈(0,1). Hence
τ1(X)≻
bτ2(X)follows from Proposition 3.2.
4 Stochastic comparisons of coherent systems with active re -

ofmnspares (or redundant components), where Yi= (Yi1,Yi2,...,Y in) is a vector of nd.i.d.
random variables, for i= 1,2,...,m. Assume that all Xj’s andYij’s are identically distributed
with a non-negaive random variable X. We write TC=τ(X∨Y1∨Y2∨ ··· ∨Ym) to denote
the lifetime of a coherent system with active redundancies a t the component level, where the
symbolX∨Y1∨Y2∨ ··· ∨Ymstands for a n-tuple vector Z= (Z1,Z2,...,Z n) such that
Zjrepresents the lifetime of a parallel system formed by ( m+ 1) independent components
{Xj,Y1j,...,Y mj}, forj= 1,2,...,n. Further, we write TS=τ(X)∨τ(Y1)∨τ(Y2)∨ ··· ∨
τ(Ym) to denote the lifetime of a coherent system with active redu ndancies at the system level,
where the symbol ∨stands for maximum. Furthermore, it is assumed that τ(X) andτ(Yi)’s
are independent, and they have the same domination function asτ(Z) has. We denote this
domination functionby h(·). Inwhatfollows, weusethenotation R(p) = (1−p)h′(p)/(1−h(p)),
p∈(0,1).
In the following theorem, we provide an equivalent conditio n to hold that the allocation of
redundancy at the component level is better/worse than that at the system level with respect
to the ageing faster order in terms of the hazard rate.

show the result.

bτk|n(X∨Y1∨ ··· ∨Ym).
Below we provide an example that illustrates the result give n in Proposition 4.1.
Example 4.1 Letm= 1. Consider a coherent system τ(X) = min{X1,X2,...,X n}formed by
nidentical components with the lifetime vector X= (X1,X2,...,X n). Further, let {X1,X2,...,X n}
have the Gumbel-Hougard copula given by

wherepi∈(0,1),i= 1,2,...,n, andθ∈[1,∞). Then the domination function of τ(X)is
given by h(p) =pa, wherea=n1/θ(≥1). This gives
R(p) =(1−p)h′(p)
(1−h(p))=a/parenleftbig

1−pa,0< p <1
and
pR′(p)
R(p)=a−1−ap+pa
1−p−pa+pa+1,0< p <1.
14Since((1−pa)/(1−p))≤a, for all a≥1andp∈(0,1), we have pR′(p)/R(p)≥0, for all
p∈(0,1). Further,
/bracketleftbiggpR′(p)

γ1(p) =a2pa−1+2(1−a2)pa+a2pa+1−p2a−1,0< p <1.
Now,
γ1′(p) =pa−2γ2(p),0< p <1,
where
γ2(p) =a2(a−1)−2a(a2−1)p+a2(a+1)p2−2apa+1,0< p <1.
Diﬀerentiating γ2(p) twice, we get
γ′
2(p) =−2a(a2−1)+2a2(a+1)p−2a(a+1)pa,0< p <1
and
γ′′

Thus, we have γ′

2(1) = 0, for all p∈(0,1), which implies γ2(p)≥γ2(1) = 0, for all
p∈(0,1). Further, this implies γ′
1(p)≥0, for all p∈(0,1), which gives γ1(p)≤γ1(1) = 0,
for allp∈(0,1). Hence pR′(p)/R(p) is decreasing in p∈(0,1). Thus, TS≺

Proposition 4.1.
5 Stochastic comparisons of a used coherent system and a co-
herent system of used components
LetXbe a random variable representing the lifetime of a componen t/system. Then its residual
lifetime at a time instant t(>0) is denoted by Xtand is deﬁned as
Xt= (X−t|X > t).
We callXtas a used component/system. Let X= (X1,X2,...,X n) be a vector of random
variables representing the lifetimes of nd.i.d. components. Then we write
Xt= ((X1)t,(X2)t,...,(Xn)t), t >0,
to represent a vector of nused components {(X1)t,(X2)t,...,(Xn)t},t >0. Consequently, we
writeτ(Xt) to denote the lifetime of a coherent system made by a set of co mponents with the
lifetime vector Xt. Further, by ( τ(X))t= (τ(X)−t|τ(X)> t), we mean the lifetime of a
used coherent system formed by a set of components with the li fetime vector X. For the sake
15of simplicity, we assume that all Xi’s are identically distributed with a non-negative random
variable X. In what follows, we denote the reliability function of τ(X) byh(·), and we write
H(p) =ph′(p)/h(p), 0< p <1.
In the following theorem we derive the necessary and suﬃcien t condition for a used coherent
system to be ageing faster than a coherent system of used comp onents in terms of the hazard
rate.
Theorem 5.1 For any ﬁxed t≥0,τ(Xt)≺

6 Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we study ageing faster orders (in terms of the h azard and the reversed hazard
rates) which are useful to compare the relative ageings of tw o systems. To be more speciﬁc,
we provide suﬃcient conditions under which one coherent sys tem is ageing more faster than
another one with respect to the hazard and the reversed hazar d rates. Further, we consider
a problem of allocation of redundancies into a coherent syst em. We show that, under some
16necessary and suﬃcient conditions, the allocation of activ e redundancy at the component level
is superior (inferior) to that at the system level with respe ct to ageing faster orders, for a
coherent system. Furthermore, a used coherent system and a c oherent system made out of used
components are compared with respect to these ageing faster orders. Apart from these, we also
show that most of our developed results hold for the well know nk-out-of-nand thel-out-of-m
systems. Nevertheless, we provide a list of examples to illu strate our proposed results. Some
counterexamples are also given wherever needed.
Even though a vast literature exists on the study of diﬀerent s tochastic orders, there are
a few results developed for the ageing faster orders. Since t he ageing faster orders compare
the relative ageings of two systems and the ageing is a common phenomenon experienced by
each and every system, the study of ageing faster orders shou ld be paid more attention from
the researchers across the world. We believe that our study n ot only enriches the literature on
ageing faster orders but also may be useful in some practical scenarios.
Similar to the problems considered in this paper, the study o f other stochastic orders (as
discussed in the introduction section), which describe the relative ageings of two systems, is
under investigation, and will be reported in future.

and
η1(u,p) is increasing in p∈(0,1),for allu∈(0,1). (6.4)
Further, since k≤landm−l≤n−k,
uk−l/parenleftbigg1−up
1−p/parenrightbiggn−k−m+l
is decreasing in u∈(0,1),
for allp∈(0,1). Then, on using Lemma 2.2 we have that, for all p∈(0,1),η1(u,p) changes
sign at most once, and if the change of sign does occur, it is fr om positive to negative, as u
traverses from 0 to 1. Finally, on using this together with (6 .3) and (6.4) in Lemma 2.1, we
get that Hl|m(p)−cHk|n(p) changes sign at most once, and if the change of sign does occu r,
it is from negative to positive, as utraverses from 0 to 1. Thus, on using Lemma 2.2, we get
thatHl|m(p)/Hk|n(p) is increasing in p∈(0,1),which further implies that Hk|n(p)/Hl|m(p) is
decreasing in p∈(0,1). Hence, the result is proved. ✷

23Then, on using Lemma 2.2 we have that η2(u,p) changes sign at most once, and if the change

24Further, for all p∈(0,1),

Proof of Corollary 4.1: Thereliability function of an n-out-of-nsystem is given by h(p) =pn.
Thus, to prove the result it suﬃces to show that (4.1) holds fo rh(p) =pnwithm= 1 and
n≥2. Note that it holds if and only if

Now,

where
ζ2(p) = 2npn−1−3(n−1)pn+npn+1−p2n,0< p <1.
This gives

where
ζ3(p) = 2( n−1)−3(n−1)p+(n+1)p2−2pn+1
≥(n−1)(2−3p+p2)
= (n−1)(2−p)(1−p)≥0,0< p <1.
This implies that ζ2(p) is increasing in p∈(0,1) withζ2(0) = 0 and ζ2(1) = 2, and hence
0≤ζ2(p)≤2. Again, this implies that ζ1(p) is increasing in p∈(0,1),and hence the result is

Further, it can be easily checked that, for all p∈(0,1),
1−(1−p)m+1≥(m+1)p(1−p)m.
SincepR′(p)/R(p) is positive for all p∈(0,1), we get from the above inequality that, for all p∈
(0,1),

R(1−(1−p)m+1).(6.26)
On combining (6.25) and (6.26), we get
pR′(p)
R(p)≥(m+1)p(1−p)mR′(1−(1−p)m+1)
R(1−(1−p)m+1,for allp∈(0,1),
or equivalently,
R(p)
R(1−(1−p)m+1)is increasing in p∈(0,1),
and hence the result follows from Theorem 4.2. ✷

Hence, the result is proved. ✷

Proof of Corollary 5.2: The reliability function of a 1-out-of- nsystem is given by h(p) =
321−(1−p)n,0< p <1.Thus, to prove the result it suﬃces to show that (5.2) holds fo r
h(p) = 1−(1−p)n,0< p <1.Note that this holds if and only if, for every ﬁxed q∈(0,1),
(1−p)n−(1−q)n
(1−p)n−1(q−p)is increasing in p∈(0,q),
or equivalently,
ζ5(y)def.=yn−1
(y−1)yn−1is decreasing in y >1.
We have
ζ′
5(y)sgn=yn−2ζ6(y), y >1,
where
ζ6(y) =−yn+ny−(n−1), y >1.
Note that ζ6(·) is a decreasing function with ζ6(1) = 0, and hence ζ6(y)≤0 for all y >1.
Further, this implies that ζ5(y) is decreasing in y >1. Hence the result is proved. ✷
