Title: Comparison of long-term natural aging to artificial aging in Duralumin
Abstract:   The understanding of long-term aging of aeronautical materials, in particular
aluminium alloys used in the fuselage and structure of aircraft is of extreme
importance for airline fleets. In this work, a plate from an old aircraft
(Breguet) was retrieved and studied in terms of microstructure and mechanical
properties. A comparison was made between this naturally-aged alloy and a
modern alloy on which different artificial aging conditions were applied. The
old alloy exhibits a precipitation of $\theta$-Al2Cu at grain boundaries and of
$\Omega$-Al2Cu on dispersoids. This non-expected nanostructure for an alloy in
T4 state was attributed to the heat that the plate experienced during the
aircraft cycles. However, it is shown that this aging is reversible (after a
solution treatment). Moreover, the very long time of outdoors exposure seems to
have caused intergranular corrosion causing the early failure during tensile
tests on some of the specimens. The artificial aging (low temperature,
100{\textdegree}C for up to 10,000h) applied on the modern 2017A alloy did not
allow to reproduce the nanostructure of the old plate, meaning that isothermal
conditions for artificial aging might not be appropriate in this case.

Abstract : The understanding of  long-term aging of aeronautical materials, in particular 
aluminium alloys used in the fuselage and structure of aircraft is of extreme importance  
for airline fleets . In this work, a plate from an old aircraft (Breguet) was retrieved and 
studied in terms of microstructure and mechanical properties. A comparison was made 
between this naturally -aged alloy and a modern alloy on which different artificial aging 
conditions were applied. The old alloy exhibit s a precipitation of θ-Al2Cu at grain 
boundaries and of Ω-Al2Cu on disper soids. This non -expected nanostructure for an alloy 
in T4 state was  attributed to the heat  that the plate  experienced during the aircraft cycles. 
However, it is shown that this aging is reversible (after a solution treatment). Moreover, 
the very long time of outdoors exposure seems to have caused intergranular  corrosion 
causing the early failure during tensile tests on some of the specimens . The art ificial aging 
(low temperature, 100°C for up to 10,000h) applied on the modern 2017A alloy did not 
allow to reproduce the nanostructure of the old plate, meaning that isothermal conditions  
for artificial aging  might not be appropriate  in this case . 
 
1. Introduction  
Long -term behaviour of aeronautical materials is of 
crucial importance  for industries as airline fleets are 
aging , with many  aircraft  reaching  their design service 
goal [1]. Alteration  due to fatigue and corrosion are the 
main concerns . The main cause s come from service 
environment : operating temperatures, loads, ambient 
environmental conditions, moisture and fluid exposures, 
radiation, maintenance and ground handling  [2]. 
Properties of materials degrade with time when expose d 
to such environment. Properties  generally  monitored are: 
mechanical static properties ( yield stress, tensile  strength, 
hardness and fracture toughness ), resistance to fatigue, 
fatigue -corrosion and corrosion resistance  [3]. 
The approach to evaluate the response of materials to 
long-term exposure in a service environment, is to impose 
either accelerated testing to assess mechanisms involving 
accumulation of damage, for example creep and high -
temperature fatigue, or accelerated aging  to generate end -
of-life microstructure by increasing temperature or loads  
through furnace treatments and/or cycling.  For age 
hardening aluminium alloys, exposure t o temperature can 
introduce microstructural changes, whether at microscale 
by the formation of subgrains or at lower scale with for 
instance the nucleation and growth of new nanostructure 
phases and the change in dislocation density. These 
changes will lea d to decrease in strength, fracture 
toughness or fatigue resistance .   
For 2xxx alloy family, several studies  were reported 
where long -term aging was simulated with temperature 
exposures  [4-7]. In 1999, a study of long -term stability 
                                                           
* Corresponding author  : magali.brunet@cemes.fr  was done by Braun et al.  [4] on 2024 -T351 alloys. The 
authors attempted to verify whether the change of 
microstructure in artificially aged alloys (aging 
temperatures between 85°C and 150°C) had an influence 
on mechanical properties and corrosion behaviour. The 
tested sheets were aluminum clad and  uncladded 1.5 mm 
thick sheets for fuselage. An interesting result was the fact 
that tensile strength, ductility and fracture toughness were 
not affected by the thermal exposure at 85°C  for 5 ,800 
hours, at 100°C  for 720  hours and at 120°C  for 3  hours. 
Only  corrosion behaviour was deteriorated  as 
intergranular corrosion appeared. This was related to the 
grain boundary precipitation occurring at these 
temperatures. For Al -Cu-Li alloys of the first generation 
in T8 state , which are known to have a unstable 
microstructure during long term ageing in service  [8], 
Deschamps et al. applied low temperature s for long times: 
1,000 h at 100°C or 3 ,000 h at 85°C [7]. They observed 
an evolution  of the yield stress during aging at 85°C and 
were able to link it to the microstructure evolution, i.e. 
precipitation of metastable phases in the volumes between 
T1 precipitates.  
Although accelerated aging proved to provide information 
on the possible evolution of materials over long -term, d ata 
from the real case  are required to co nfirm or infirm the 
predictions  based on artificial aging for aeronautic 
materials. Indeed , cycles end ured by aircraft  during its 
life-time are not isothermal. To do so, an interesting 
approach is to observ e the microstructure and measuring 
the macroscopic properties of alloys retrieved on end -of-
life aircraft and compare them to an equivalent alloy on 
which artificial aging is being conducted . There have been   2 
 few attempts of such studies in the literature . Salimon at 
al. [9] have  studied aged  D16AT alloys  (Russian 
nomenclature , equivalent of 2024 -T4) retrieved from the 
fuselage skin of three Russian TU-154 aircraft which flew 
respectively 11, 15 and 20  years.  They showed that for 
uncorroded parts, mechanical characteristics (yield stress, 
tensile strength and elongation to fracture) did not evolve. 
Low-stress, high -cycle fatigue d id not  cause dramatical 
structure changes in the bulk material . Only the near -
surface layer was influenced by high -cycle fatigue, giving 
rise to micro -cracks and fracture of oxide film and thus 
corrosion . Schmidt et al. [1] studied 2024 -T3 sheets taken 
from an Airbus 300 fuselage with 18 years of service 
usage  (75% of its design service goal) . Here too, although 
the old sheets exhibit ed a high susceptibility to 
intergranular corrosion, all properties tested (strength, 
elongation, fracture  toughness, crack growth rate) we re 
equal or even slightly better than the required properties. 
Our team dem onstrated recently the interest in studying 
materials  from old aircrafts (kept in museum or 
associations)  [10]. Two plates recovered from a Breguet 
Sahara Deux -Ponts  which first flew in 1958, were studied 
and compared. It appeared that the mechanical properties 
(yield stress, tensile strength and elongation) of these 60 
years -old plates still conform to the standards of that time. 
Prudhomme et al. [6] compared mechanical properties of 
AA 2024 from a decommissioned A320 aircraft (wing 
panels) to an artificially aged alloy. They found similar 
results for an end -of-life material and an alloy artificially 
aged for 55h at 150°C. This aging treatment was chosen 
from  an equivalence rule based on the Arrhenius law. The 
assumption is that homogeneous precipitation of second 
phases resulting from decomposition of a solid solution is 
controlled by the diffusion of copper atoms. The 
activation energy for copper diffusion is defined thanks to 
the model developed by Khan and Starink [11] for Al -Cu-
Mg alloys . With this equivalence rule, 55h at 150°C 
should thus correspond to 100,000h exposure at 80°C, a 
service life of an aircraft. As a result, Prudhomme et al. 
showed that f atigue lives were indeed comparable as well 
as fracture mechanics.  
In order t o verify whether  long-term artificial aging is 
representative of natur al aging  in the case of Duralumi n, 
this article presents  a comparison between an old alloy  retrieved from the Breguet Sahara Deux -Ponts and a 
modern equivalent alloy  2017A. Different heat treatment s 
were applied to assess the aging on the old alloy, i.e. 
solution treatment and artificial ag ing at 180°C . Long -
term artificial aging at 100°C was applied to the modern 
alloy 2017A to simulate long -term natural aging (in -situ). 
Mechanical te sts (hardness, tensile tests) followed by 
scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) fractography were 
conducted . Transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) was 
used to observ e the nanostructure  at different stages  and 
to interpret the macroscopic behaviour of the art ificially 
and naturally -aged alloys.   
2. Experimental  
2.1. Materials  
A plate  labelled L8 (1.6 mm thick) recovered from the 
engine nacelle of a Breguet Sahara Deux -Ponts already 
observed in [10] is the naturally -aged plate . A commercial 
1 mm thick plate made of 2017A  alloy  in state T4 was 
bought: it is the modern alloy on which artificial aging 
will be conducted.  On this alloy, a comprehensive study 
of the precipitation was previously conducted as it 
constitutes the first step to properly understand further 
aging [13]. 
Table 1 reports the elementary composition for each  alloy 
measured by ICP -OES  (Inductively Coupl ed Plasma  - 
Optical Emission Spectrometry ). The old plate is made of 
A-U4G (French designation used in 1950  for Duralumin) . 
Compared with t he equivalent  modern alloy , it has a lower  
content  of copper and a higher  content  of magnesium.  
To assess aging, different aging treatments were applied, 
as described in Table 2. For the plate collected on the 
aircraft, labelled “AR” for as -received , no pre -treatment 
was applied. We know however from Breguet standards 
[14] that these pieces underwent upon fabrica tion a T4 
treatment: solution treatment followed by water quench 
and room temperature aging. For this plate, the AR state 
corresponds thus to a T4 + 10 years of service + 50 years 
in outdoor conditions. The following treatments described 
in the table were all applied on the as -received alloys in 
the laboratory.

 2.2. Characterization techniques  
Tensile  specimens were cut in each plate: 4 in rolling 
direction and 4 in the transverse direction. The gauge 
length/reduced section and width of the tensile 
specimen are 20 mm and 3 mm respectively.  The 
thickness of the 2017A plate and the L8 plate are 1 
mm and 1.6 mm respectively. Tensile tests were 
performed at a strain rate of 0.02 s-1, on a Zwick Z030 
with a MTS extensometer.  SEM pictures of fracture 
surfaces were taken on a JEOL 6490.  
Micro har dness m easurements were done with a 
Buehler Omnimet series 2100, following the ASTM 
E384 standard. Average results on 5 indents with a 
load of 300g during 10s were plotted. For these 
measurements , the alloys were cut along three 
perpendicular orientations:  rolling direction  (RD), 
normal direction  (ND) and transverse direction  (TD) 
and each specimen  was embedded in an epoxy resin 
and mechanically polished on water -lubricated 
abrasive papers (silicon carbide) then on polishing 
cloths with diamond paste.  
For TEM observations, the preparation was the 
following: to bring the sample thickness down to 25  
µm, a mechanical polishing on SiC paper from 600 
down to 2400 grade was performed. The specimens 
were then electrochemically thinned using a Tenupol -
5 Struers app aratus operating at 60  V in a solution of 
methanol and nitric acid (3:1) at -15°C. Observations 
of the nanostructure were carried out on a JEOL 2010 
operating at 200 kV.  Bright field (BF) images were 
taken with an orientation slightly off the [100]Al or the 
[110]Al zone axis. The length of n anoprecipitates  
(platelets)  were estimated on BF images by averaging 
30 measurements.   
SAXS measurements were performed o n a Xeuss® 
equipment (Xenocs) equipped with a microsource 
with copper anode.  Samples were thinned down to 100 
µm. 3 samples -to-detector distances were considered 
(40 cm, 1.2 m and 2.5m).  
3. Results  
3.1. As-received state  
3.1.1.  Mechanical properties  
The engineering stress -strain curves for the modern 
plate  (2017A ) and the old plate (L8) , both in the as -
received state  are shown in Figure 1  for two direction s: 
rolling direction (RD) and transverse direction (TD). 
For L8, a circular plate, it was not possible to identify 
straightforwardly the directions [10]: a labelling D1 and D2 was thus used . They are supposedly the rolling 
and transverse direction respectively . Figure 1.a 
reveals that tensile strength curves exhibit good 
reproducibility for 2017A. On the old alloy  however , 
a heterogeneous behaviour is observed. Early failure 
occurs quite often in direction D2, the estimated 
transverse direction. Table 1 summarizes the main 
mechanical properties . If early-failed specimens  are 
not taken into account, the yield strength  (YS), the 
ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and the elongation are 
conformed to the expectation for such alloy  [15].

3.1.1.  Fracture surface analysis  
Fracture surface analysis was c arried out by SEM on 
post-mortem  specimens. Figure 2 presents images 
representative of each alloy. On both alloys, equiaxed 
dimples were observed, typically present for d uctile 
fracture  caused by uniaxial tensile load. This type of 
fracture  processes by mi crovoid coalescence. 
Microvoids nucleate at particles such as precipitates . 
After nucleation, the voids grow in the direction of the 
applied tensile stress.  The dimples caused by coarse 
intermetallics are clearly visible in the microstructure 
of both alloy s. Coarse intermetallics in 2017A -type 
alloys are well -identified: AlMnFeSi mostly (large, 
grey particles with faceted morphology) together with 
Al2Cu (round and bright) and Mg 2Si (dark). They are 
quite numerous in both samples. Extremely small 
dimples wer e also present which could be caused by 
intragranular precipitation.  
In the old alloy  (L8), on all the early -failed specimens 
occurring mainly in the transverse direction, 
decohesive fracture along grain boundaries were 
observed (see framed area in Figure  2c and d.). 
Intergranular corrosion , unspotted before testing on 
the specimens , seems to be the main cause of this 
rupture mode. It is known that alloys of the 2xxx series 
are susceptible to stress -corrosion cracking and that 
the sensitivity depends stron gly on the grain 
orientation. The transverse direction is thus the most 
susceptible to cracking, which is observed here.

3.2. Assessment of aging on  old plate  
(L8) 
3.2.1.  Microhardness  
Microhardness was measured  versus the aging time  at 
180°C  for both plates , in as -received state (AR) and 
after a solution treatment  (ST). Because the mate rials 
exhibit similar hardness in three orientation (R D, TD 
and N D), only hardness in R D is plotted  in Figure 3.  
Artificial aging  (180°C)  was first applied on the as -
received samples . For 2017A alloy, i n the early stages 
of the treatment at 180°C, the hardness is decreasing due to the dissolution of Guinier -Preston Zones 
(GPZ ), already present in T4 stage. Then it increases 
up to a maximum (peak harden ing) reaching 136 
HV0.3 after 8h before decreasing (o ver-aging stage). 
L8-AR exhibits a peculiar hardness behaviour upon 
artificial aging at 180°C . The hardness  indeed  does not 
reach a maximum after 8h at 180°C , but stays at its 
original value around 120 HV0.3 . The attribution of 
such a poor behaviour in har dness to an alteration due 
to the history of the plate during the plane service is a 
possible explanation.  
To verify if this behaviour  is due to a long-term natural 
aging  and to assess the reversibility of the 
  5 
 phenomenon , the hardness of  the old plate w as re-
measured a fter being solution treat ed at 500°C for 1 
hour, quench ed in water  and maturat ed again . After 
this treatment, h ardness of L8-ST is 123 HV0.3, close 
to the hardness before treatment.  
Aging treatment at 180°C was then re-applied . In this 
case, hardness  of the old alloy  follows the behaviour  
of the alloy 2017A , reaching a maximum after 8h  (see 
curve L8 -ST in Figure 3) . It can be concluded that t he 
history of the  Breguet’s plate was erased. Its aging is 
thus reversible.  
 
Fig. 3. Hardness HV0.3 me asurement  in the rolling direction  
of modern alloy 2017A and L8 ( A-U4G ) when aging at 
180°C  from an as-received state  (AR) and after solution 
treatment  (ST). The reasons for this behaviour in the AR state are 
investigated with the observation of the micro and 
nanostructure.  
 
3.2.2.  Microstructure  
On L8-AR, TEM observations (see Figure 4.a and 4.b) 
reveal a precipitation at grain boundaries and the 
presence of a p recipitation on dispersoids . The 
precipitation is marked by arrows in BF-TEM image 
(Figure 4 a) and circles in the corresponding selected 
area diffraction ( SAD ) pattern. This phase 
corresponds to Ω -Al2Cu phase, as identified in [13] on 
similar Duralumin . No other precipitation is observed 
in this sample by TEM  but it was verified by small 
angle X -ray scattering ( SAXS ) that GPZ/clusters are 
present in this state  (see Figure 5). The results show 
indeed two main contributions:  one in the low q -range 
(0.002 < q < 0.1 Å-1) with a q-4 contribution , attributed 
to large precipitates (dispersoids) and one at high q -
range (0.1 <  q < 1 Å-1), a plateau attributed to GPZ or 
small c lusters in the alloy matrix.  
At grain boundaries, the precipitation nature is Al 2Cu. 
Precipitation on dispersoids and at grain boundaries 
could be the sign of the heat experienced by the plate 
during its life -time.  After solution treatment ( ST), 
precipitation on dispersoids  and at grain boundaries 
has disappeared : see Figure 4.c and 4.d.

Fig. 5.  SAXS curves for L8 (3 different zones) in the as -
received state.  
 
The nanostructure is then observed for 2017A and  L8 
after treatment at 180°C for 8h corresponding to peak 
hardening . It is s hown in Figure 6. The observation s 
of the old plate (Figur e 6.a) reveals the presence of a 
variety of phases:  
- the hardening θ”-Al3Cu phase identified in the 
SAD patterns thanks to the discontinuous streaks 
along [200]Al [16],  
- the θ’-Al2Cu phase  (platelets)  identified thanks to 
faint spots (110) θ’ at ½ of (220) Al,  
- the Q ’(Q)-AlCuMgSi phase  which are rods 
observed end-on in the [100]Al direction in the BF 
images , 
- the Ω-Al2Cu phase  with diffraction spots at 1/3 
and 2/3 of the [022] Al orientation . 
 
This precipitates zoology is equivalent  to the one 
found in the modern 2017A alloy  in the same aging 
conditions  (Figure 6.b and [13]). Measurements of the 
hardening precipitates (θ”-Al3Cu and θ’ -Al2Cu 
platelets ) are reported in Table 3. On average , platelets  
are 86 ± 29 nm  long for L8_180°C/8h  and 60 ± 15 nm 
long for 2017A _180°C/8h . The difference is not 
significant enough to conclude . However, a  much 
higher number of dislocations are found in the old 
plate  indicating some work -hardening of the L8 plate 
during its shaping  or during its lifespan .  
After  ST followed by aging at 180°C for 8h , the 
nanostructure is observed again : see Figure 6.c. The 
platelet s are measured: in the old plate, they are 65 ± 
18 nm , and  dislocations have disappeared.  
 
Table 3.  Measurements  of hardening precipitates (Platelets 
from θ sequence)

L8_180°C/8h  86 ± 29 
L8_ST-180°C/8h  65 ± 18 
 
These results show that hardening precipitation occurs 
after artificial aging (180°C -8h) in L8, in a similar 
manner as the 2017A alloy  whether in the as-received state or after solution treatment . This  means that the 
peculiar behaviour of the L8 in  hardness during 
thermal aging  (observed in Figure 2) is not due to a 
lack of hardening precipitation . The reason for the 
hardness stagnation  on the old plate is thus suspected 
to be found at microscale.

3.3. Long -term  aging  on modern 
alloy  2017A  
As mentioned before, hardening precipitation in these 
alloys of the 2xxx family is  considered as being  
controlled by the diffusion of copper atoms. The time -
temperature equivalence s can be used based on  the 
copper  diffusion and Arrhenius law [11]. In a recent 
PhD thesis work [17], several alloys among which

 2024, we re artificially aged at different temperatures 
in the range from 85 °C to 250°C for different 
durations varying from 1 to 10 ,000h . Time -
temperature equivalences based on microstructure 
evolution were found to be accurate for pre and post 
peak -hardening. Experimental data (mecha nical 
properties) followed the predicted behaviour based on 
the evolution of the S -phase fraction.   
Here, l ow-temperature artificial ageing (100°C) was 
applied on the modern 2017A alloy until 10,000h to 
simulate long -term aging. As hardening is based on 
copper diffusion, the assumption is made that the 
precipitation along the θ sequence  should follow the 
same law. The time -temperature equivalence was then 
used with an activation energy for copper diffusion 
equal to 133 kJ/mol . In this case, it was calculated that 
the low temperature aging  (100°C, 10,000h)  should be 
equivalent to 5 h at 180°C.  
 
3.3.1.  Microhardness measurement  
For 100°C, hardness reaches 145 HV0.3 after 10 ,000h  
which is significantly higher than peak aging at 180°C  
(136 HV0.3) . The h igher hardness obtained at low 
temperature aging  is classically observed in age -
hardening alloys [18].    
 
3.3.2.  Microstructure  
The microstructure corresponding to an aging time of 
10 000h at 100°C  is shown in Figure  7 and the one for 
5h at 180°C in Figure 8.

In the SAD patterns in two zone axes ([100]Al and 
[110]Al), for the 2017A alloy  heat treated at 100°C for 
10,000h, we observe  discontinuous streaks along 
[200] Al with maximum intensities at (100) Al 
corresponding to  the θ”-Al3Cu phase . The θ’-Al2Cu 
precipitates , if present , have a low volume density . 
The Q’(Q)-AlCuMgSi  phase was observed in the BF 
images (rods seen en d-on oriented along [001] Al 
directio n) but the precipitates  are also very few . The  
diffraction patterns,  similar as the ones seen in  [16], 
indicate that the alloy is just before peak hardening . 
Figure 8 provides the confirmation of a nanostructure 
very close to the one previously presented (for 8h at 
180°C). The length of the hardening precipitates  in the 
two aging conditions , is of th e same order of 
magnitude (see Table 4). A major difference can be 
found for the  Ω-Al2Cu phase : this phase was hardly 
seen in the  2017A alloy aged at 100°C for 10,000h : 
diffraction spots are not visible in the  SAD patterns  
(inserts of Figure 7.a and 7.b). However, the phase can 
be seen on dispersoids in BF -TEM images . It is 
concluded that the phase is present but  in very little 
quantities  and with no significant influence .  
4. Discussion  
4.1. Long -term natural aging  
L8 plate exhibits a peculiar mechanical behav iour and 
microstructure in the AR conditions , i.e. after 10 years 
of service and 5 0 years  in outdoor environment . 
Limited elongation (or early failure) was explained by 
intergranular rupture mod e due most probably to 
intergranular corrosion present in the plate . 
Precipitation at grain boundaries (Al 2Cu) was indeed 
observed on the AR plate  by TEM . This is  clearly the 
sign of a heat exposure during the aircraft life -time.  
  8 
 This precipitation induce s a f ragilization of the 
material upon exposure to environment  (50 years 
outdoors) . Another precipitation was observed in L8 -
AR: the Ω-Al2Cu phase , which grows on dispersoids . 
But this precipitation has no hardening effect on the 
alloy in the AR state:  overall  L8-AR exhibits a similar 
hardness as 2017A.  Upon artificial treatment 
(180°C/8h), hardness of the old plate did  not reach a 
maximum, as opposed  to the modern alloy 2017A, 
although hardening precipitation was observed inside 
the grains by TEM. We believe that micro hardness is 
thus affected by  precipitatio n at grain boundar ies. In 
the AR -state, t he high dislocation density observed in 
L8 is the sign of work hardening  that compensate for  
the loss of hardness due to intergranular precipitation . 
However, t his intergranular precipitation decrease s 
the potential  for further hardening in th e old plate  upon 
aging .  
When a solution treatment is applied: precipitation on 
grain boundaries and on dispersoids ( Ω-Al2Cu) 
disappear.  The solution treatment  erase s thus  the long -
term aging of the plate. Consequently, t he L8 behaves 
according to the modern alloy. The aging is reversible.  
 
4.2. Artificial aging at low temperature  
Artificial  aging at low temperature (100°C) was 
applied on 2017A alloy to simulate natural aging. If 
time-temperature equivalence based on  Arrhenius law 
is used, 10,000h at 100°C should correspond to 5h at 
180°C.  However, d ifferences in hardness and in 
microstructure can be noticed  between these two aging 
conditions .  
The different age hardening responses at different 
aging temperature can be explained wit h 
thermodynamic considerations [18]. The free energy 
change per unit volume, i.e. the driving force for 
precipitate nucleation, is stron gly influenced by the 
alloy composition and the aging temperature. It is 
higher for low temperature which makes the activity 
energy barrier to be the lowest, considering that  the 
change of  elastic strain energy  and the change of  
interfacial energy  are negligible  versus  aging 
tempera ture in this first phase of GPZ and θ” 
nucleation . The maximum nucleation rate and 
therefore the maximum density of precipitates is 
achieved for  lower temperature s, hence the maximum 
hardness for aging temperature of 100°C . From the 
TEM observations  on the 2017A thermally aged at 
100°C for 10,000h , the presence of coherent 
precipitates ( θ”-Al3Cu) indicate s that homogeneous 
nucleation is dominant . Although the  observed 
platelets are of the same length  as for the 180°C/5h 
conditions , the density of these precipitates was not 
precisely estimated  but it appears higher after  aging at 
100°C than after aging at 180°C .  
Another difference is noted between the two aging 
conditions: the presence of Ω-Al2Cu phase  was very 
rarely spotted after aging at low temperature  (100°C) . 
In AA2 519 alloy  (Al-5.6Cu -0.3Mn -0.3Mg -0.15Zr 
wt.%) , Zuiko and Kaibyshev [19] showed that the precipitation of Ω-Al2Cu phase happens right after  the 
θ”-Al3Cu phase precipitation and before the 
precipitation of the θ’-Al2Cu phase. This is due to the 
free energy of the Ω-Al2Cu phase , which is higher than 
that of the θ”-Al3Cu phase. As it was shown that at 
100°C/10,000h, the alloy is just before peak -
hardening  and the θ”-Al3Cu phase is in the majority . It 
might  require longer time at this temperature to 
generate the Ω-Al2Cu phase.   
 
Compari ng 2017A artificially aged at 100°C with L8 -
AR, it has to be said that  it was not possible to 
reproduce a similar nanostructure with a low -
temperature aging. Long -term n atura l aging implies 
non-isothermal exposure (due to the aircraft take-off 
and landing cycles) which can indeed produce 
unpredicted nanostructure. T he presence of the Ω-
Al2Cu phase on L8 might thus be explained by cycles 
of high -low temperatures experienced by the plate 
near the engine. Another hypothesis could also be 
found in the alloy composition itself: the slightly  
higher  content  of magnesium  in L8 (0.83  wt.% ) 
compared with that of the 2017A  (0.68  wt.% ) could 
help trigger this phase in L8 (always upon a heat 
treatment) . It was shown indeed by Zuiko and 
Kaibyshev [19] that magnesium  enhances  the 
precipitation of transient phases.  
5. Conclusions  
From different measurements and observations at 
various scales on two aluminium alloys, an old one 
(L8) and a moder n one (2017A), the following 
conclusions can be drawn:  
• The s tatic m echanical behaviour  remains globally 
unchanged : upon deformation,  L8 behaves 
similarly as 2017A alloy except for some 
specimens affected by intergranular precipitation 
and probably intergranular corrosion which 
cause d early fracture .  
• The hardness of L8 in the AR state, although close 
to 2017A’s one, is not following the same 
hardening curve upon aging at 180°C. However,  
TEM studies reveal that  hardening precipitation  
in L8 occurs in a similar manner as  in 2017A.  
A solution treatment (500°C/1h  followed by a 
quench ) allowed to erase the particular 
microstructure on L8 -AR, that is precipitation at 
grain boundaries and on dispersoids. After this, 
the hardness follows a typi cal curve with a peak -
hardening  after 8h.  
• Time -temperature equivalence is not entirely 
confirmed between 180°C and 100°C: hardening 
precipitation  (platelets)  is of the same order of 
magnitude in length but hardness is different . This 
is explained by a hig her volume fraction of 
precipitates at 100°C. Furthermore, the Ω-Al2Cu 
phase is hardly  present at 100°C : this aging 
temperature is thus below the Ω solvus.    9 
 • Long -term artificial aging on modern alloy was 
not able to reproduce the aging of the naturally -
aged alloy (in -situ). This is due to the non -
isothermal nature of the aging in the real case.
