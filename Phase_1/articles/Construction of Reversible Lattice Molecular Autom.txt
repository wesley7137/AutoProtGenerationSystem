1 Introduction
Possessing and utilizing multiple levels of self-organized structures— sometimes
addressed as dynamical hierarchies [1,2]—is a characteristic feature of biologi-
cal systems. Cellular automata (CA) and similar discrete paradigms h ave been
eﬀective in modeling such dynamical self-organization hierarchies. I n the con-
text of molecular aggregation, lattice molecular automata (LMA) simulates self-
organizationof water(polar solvent), monomers, and polymers int o clusters and
higher-order structures such as micelles[ 3,4,5], and similar models have been
developed to simulate organizationof compartment structure and proto-cell-like
self-reproduction[ 6,7].
However, these models do not obey microscopic reversibility and conser-
vation laws, and therefore, the possibility and stability of the self-o rganized
structures in these models are, to some extent, implied in their irrev ersible time
evolution rules. Under the laws of physics, stable persistence of an organized
structure requires eﬀective utilization of limited resources and smo oth disposal
of generated entropy. Therefore, the constraint of reversibilit y should not be
omitted in studying the necessary conditions for stable structure s, using, for
example, the canonical methods of statistical physics.
1In this paper, we describe the construction of reversible lattice molecular
automata (RLMA), which simulates self-organization of water, monomers, an d
polymers with a strictly reversible dynamics and physically appropriat e conser-
vation laws. Although several reversible CA models have been propo sed to sim-
ulate self-organization processes[ 8,9], our model can simulate self-organization
of structures with mobility, which will be essential for realizing higher-order
structures and higher functionality such as autonomy.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. A formal deﬁnition of C A is
providedandusefultechniquesinconstructingreversibleCAareb rieﬂyreviewed
in Section 2. Features of the original LMA model and its relation to ot her
models are also brieﬂy reviewed there. The construction of our RLM A model
is described in Section 3, along with the conservation laws derived fro m the
reversible dynamics. Some simulations of monomers and polymers in po lar
solvent are presented in Section 4. Finally, our conclusion is drawn in S ection
5. Appendix A presents an alternative approach for implementing re versible
molecular rotation.
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Formalization of CA
On ad-dimensional spatial lattice Zd, each site (cell) i∈Zdis assigned with
itslocal stateωi∈A. The ﬁnite set Aof local states is called an alphabet. A
speciﬁcation of local states over the whole space ω/defines(ωi)i∈Zd∈Ω=AZdis
called aglobal state orconﬁguration .
The dynamics of a CA is given by the local transition map ϕas
ωt+1
i=ϕ/parenleftbig
(ωt
j)j∈N(i)/parenrightbig
, (1)
where the neighbor function N:i/mapsto→(j1,...,jN) deﬁnes interaction range for
each site i. By applying the local map ϕover the lattice, the global transition
map
ωt+1=Φ(ωt) (2)
from a conﬁguration at tto the one at t+1 is derived. Although the applica-
tion ofϕover the space is synchronous in simple CA, making it asynchronous
can be eﬀective in satisfying reversibility and other constraints, as shown later.
Furthermore, in more complicated CA, the local map ϕconsists not of a single
map but of several maps (sub-steps), and the local states ωi∈Aalso have inner
structures such as “partitions” or “layers.”
When the global transition map Φis bijective, that is, when for any conﬁg-
urationωt+1its pre-image ωtis unique, the CA is reversible (orinvertible ).
2.2 Construction of reversible CA
Reversibility entails conservation of information —diﬀerences in states cannot
just appear from or vanish into nowhere. Hence the manner in which to prevent
2information loss is crucial in constructing reversible CA.
Since the many-to-onelocaltransitionmap ϕin Eq.(1) obviouslylosesinfor-
mationbyitself(Fig. 1(a)),thelossshouldbepreventedbywell-counterbalanced
distribution among the interacting cells. However, designing such ma ps is far
from trivial. Indeed, judging the reversibilityof a global transition m apΦ, given
its corresponding local map ϕ, is a diﬃcult task in itself.
An easier method to construct reversible CA is by adopting a permutation
(reversible transformation on a ﬁnite set) ψ,
ψ:AB→AB, (3)
instead of a many-to-one mapping ϕ, as a constituent of the transition rule
(Fig.1(b)). Here, Bdenotes a “block” of cells under the permutation. In
Partitioning CA (orblock CA )[10], for example, both the reversibilityand global
transmission of information are satisﬁed by combining the permutat ion and
alternation of diﬀerent partitioning schemes of a given space into ce ll-blocks.
The permutation ( 3) can be generalized into a conditional permutation as
ψc:AS→AS, c∈AC. (4)
Out of the set C+Sof cells that are subject to the mapping, the states of cells
inCwork as “control signals,” which determine a permutation for the st ates of
S, and reappear unchanged as outputs (Fig. 1(c)). The Fredkin gate and the
Toﬀoli gate are well-known examples of conditional permutations.
Figure 1: Mappings to constitute transition: (a) many-to-one map ping, (b)
permutation, and (c) conditional permutation.
To prevent information loss, the outputs of the (conditional) perm utations
should be reused as inputs or conditional signals, and to achieve this , one needs
to implement certain techniques such as dividing a time step into sever alsub-
steps, and arranging the permutations sparsely and asynchronously in space-
time[11].
For synchronous information transmission, one can also use global shifts,
which uniformly displace some partitions or layers of local states. Th e transla-
tional movement of free particles can be eﬀectively modeled by the s hifts. In
lattice gas automata (LGA)[12,13], for example, shifts are utilized to express
the translation of gas particles, in combination with permutations th at repre-
sent the collisions of the particles. Partitioned CA [14] is virtually equivalent to
the LGA.
32.3 LMA model and other models
Variousmodelshavebeenproposedandusedtosimulatemolecularse lf-organization
processes. On the one hand, the molecular dynamics (MD) method m odels
molecules as particles with appropriate interaction potentials, and s olves their
equations of motion in continuous space[ 15]. While the MD enables micro-
scopically detailed description of the dynamics, size of the simulated s ystem is
restricted by the available computer resources. On the other han d, lattice-type
models have been successful on simulating macroscopic behavior of phase sepa-
ration and aggregation processes. Especially the Larson model[ 16,17,18] and
its variants[ 19,20,21,22] are widely used and many results are reported. In the
traditional Larson model simulating ternary mixture of water, oil ( hydropho-
bic monomers), and surfactant (amphiphilic polymers), water and h ydrophobic
monomers are represented by a set of up and down (+1 ,−1) spins, respectively,
and polymers are represented by strings of spins. Monte Carlo met hod is used
for update and the ferromagnetic interaction between the spins in duces phase
separation, micelle formation, etc.
The original LMA model bridges the gap between the MD method and t he
Larson-typemodels[ 5]: While realizedin adiscrete mannerandthus keepingthe
eﬃciency of the lattice setting, it includes some microscopic molecular details,
such as hydrodynamics conserving momenta in the molecular collision, direc-
tions of polar molecules and accompanied anisotropy of molecular pot ential
energy. A distinguishing feature of the LMA model is the equienerge tic inter-
action for the pairs water–hydrophobic monomer and hydrophobic monomer–
hydrophobic monomer, following experimental data on enthalpy exc hanges in
mixtures[ 23]. This setting is in contrast to the Larson models, which deﬁne
positive enthalpic gains for oil–oil interaction but not for water–oil in teraction.
Consequently, in the LMA model phase separation is realized via entropy-driven
hydrophobic eﬀect, and not enthalpy-driven as in the Larson-typ e models.
Although update rule of the LMA model partially keeps the conserva tion
laws, its dynamics is not microscopically reversible (refer to section I V.B and
V of Ref. [ 3] for example to see the total energy is conserved in the mean but
not strictly and explicitly). Therefore, utilizing the techniques intro duced in
section2.2, we construct our RLMA model in the next section.
3 RLMA Model
3.1 Space
WeformalizetheRLMAmodelonthetwo-dimensionaltriangularlattic e(Fig.2(a),
(b)) as in the literature[ 3,4], although generalization to other lattice struc-
tures and to higher dimensions will be straightforward. We use the v ariable
l∈ {+1,+2,+3,−1,−2,−3}≡Lto denote the principal directions, and l(i) to
denote cell i’s nearest neighbor in direction l, as shown in Fig. 2(c).Lcorre-
sponds to {0,π/6,...,5π/6}in the equilateral triangular lattice with a proper
coordinate system (Fig. 2(c)), and on L, we deﬁne a cyclic permutation ∆ of
4length 6,
∆ =/parenleftbigg+1 +2 +3 −1−2−3
+2 +3 −1−2−3 +1/parenrightbigg
, (5)
which corresponds to + π/6 rotation operator for the principal directions.

3.2 Local states
Each local state has the layers(internal data structure) shown in Table 1.

(empty; V). For example, one can consider the hydrophilic monomer to be
acetic acid and the hydrophobic monomer to be methane. A site can c ontain at
most one molecule; this constraint corresponds to excluded volume .
5Figure 3: Molecular types. Upper row: schematic illustrations. Lowe r row:
representations in visualization of the simulation results; bars indica te the ori-
entations of polar molecules.
Water and hydrophilic monomers are polar molecules; therefore, th ey have
molecule orientation mo i∈L. (For hydrophobic monomers and vacuum,
moi= null.) We deﬁne that, for water in orientation mo, the same direction
represents negative polarization (corresponding to one oxygen) and ∆±2(mo)
represents positive polarization (corresponding to two hydrogen s), and for a
hydrophilic monomer in orientation mo, ∆±1(mo) represents negative polariza-
tion (corresponding to O or OH) (See Fig. 3). Molecular orientation aﬀects the
strength of potential energy induced by several kinds of molecular interaction
(see section 3.3).
The sites occupied by molecules have translational kinetic energy (TKE)
tkei,l∈ {0,1}in every principal direction l∈L, although non-zero energy
values in opposite directions on the same line are forbidden ( tkei,l+tkei,−l≤1).
Hence, there are 27 possible TKE states for a molecule (Fig. 4).
Figure 4: Possible states of translational kinetic energy for a molec ule.
Molecules can have rotational kinetic energy (RKE)rkei, which allows the
rotation of the polar molecules to be reversible (see section 3.4.4). For proper
6update by the rotation rule given here, we conﬁne the value of rkeito{+1,−1}
for polar molecules, and to zero for non-polar molecules or vacuum. (For an
alternative setting, see Appendix A.)
Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic monomers can have molecular bonds with
neighboring monomers. We deﬁne that
mbi,l=/braceleftbigg
1 if two monomers at iandl(i) are bonded ,
0 otherwise .(6)
(Thus,mbi,l=mbl(i),−l.)Polymers can be composed as a group of monomers
linked by the bonds, as shown in Fig. 5. In the current study, we suppose that
for each monomer to have the bonds in at most two directions,/summationtext
l∈Lmbi,l≤2;
thus, the polymers are one-dimensional. One can consider the polym ers to be
fatty acids.
Figure 5: Schematic representation of a polymer.
For the above layers, which are related to molecules, we also overlay theheat
particles layer on each cell. The heat particle variable hi,lcan take values of
{0,...,H max}independently for every direction l∈L.
Finally, we append the preferential direction pdi∈Lfor each cell i. In the
transitionrule given below, the preferentialdirection worksas a “ﬂ uctuation”to
breakirreversibility-inducingsymmetry. The parityofthepreferentialdirection,
deﬁned by
parity(pdi) =/braceleftbigg+1 ifpdi∈ {+1,+3,−2},
−1 ifpdi∈ {+2,−1,−3},(7)
is also utilized in the transition rule.
Molecular type, orientation, TKE and, molecular bonds (or variables equiv-
alent to them) are included in the original LMA[ 4,5]. On the other hand,
RKE, heat particles, and preferential direction are introduced in t his model to
implement reversibility in a physically appropriate manner.
73.3 Potential energy
Every molecule interacts with its nearest neighboring molecules;1therefore, it
haspotential energies for each of the six principal directions. In calculating
potential energy, we consider only pairwise interactions, and let Vi,l(i)denote
potential energy arising from the interaction between molecules at iandl(i).
The molecular interaction is divided into three classes:2
•Electrostaticinteractionsbetween permanent multipoles, which ta ke place
when the polarized directions of the two polar molecules face each ot her.
LetVperm−permrepresent the potential energy contribution from this class
of interactions.
•Induction-based interactions between a permanent multipole and a n in-
ducedmultipole, whichtakeplacewhenapolarizeddirectionofonemole cule
faces an originally non-polarized direction of another. Let Vperm−indrep-
resent the potential energy contribution from this class of intera ctions.
•London dispersion interactions between induced multipoles, which ta ke
place when the surfaces of two non-polar molecules face each othe r. Let
Vind−indrepresent the potential energy contribution from this class of in-
teractions.
Then, the total potential energy in the system is calculated as

For the full speciﬁcation of the potential terms in our model, the int eger
parameters listed in Table 2must be given.
3.4 Transition rule
In the original LMA model, each unit-time update consists of the follo wing
sub-steps[ 4]:
1. propagation of the molecular type and redistribution of kinetic en ergies,
2. construction of type-speciﬁc force ﬁelds,
3. calculation of potential energies,
4. calculation of the most proper move direction,
5. readjustment of bonds in polymers according to the move direct ion, and
6. movement of the molecule and clearing of the old lattice position.
1Although wider range of interaction can also be modeled, it r equires larger number of site
groupsand more complicated update schemes (see section 3.4).
2We omit cooperativity eﬀects because of their minor inﬂuenc e on the simulation results.

in actuality, involving erasure and duplication of information. To realiz e re-
versibility, therefore, we reconstruct the sub-steps and creat e new ones, utilizing
the techniques introduced in section 2.2.
3.4.1 Molecular translation, collision, and excluded volu me
In the LMA, for each molecule, the most proper move direction is calc ulated
based on its TKEs and potentials, and the molecule moves to the direc tion if
the movement satisﬁes the constraints of excluded volume and mole cular bond
maintenance. This rule causes situations whose pre-images are not unique (e.g.,
a molecule at a site might havecome from one ofthe neighboringsites a ccording
to the most proper move direction, or might have been at the same s ite a unit
time ago because of the constraints), and thus it is irreversible.
To satisfy the constraints of excluded volume and molecular bond ma inte-
nance, and to realize reversibility at the same time, we introduce site groups .
Sites in each group should be scattered uniformly and sparsely enou gh (to pre-
vent interference of the pairwise interactions deﬁned below, the s ites in each
group should be separated by at least four times the unit distance) . We deter-
mine the group to which site ibelongs at time tby the following map
g(i,t) ={4(ixmod 4)+(iymod 4)+t}mod 16, (9)
andletG={0,1,...,15}denotetherangeof g. Here(ix,iy) arethecoordinates
of siteigiven by the axis in Fig. 2(c), and each site is assigned to a group, as
shown in Fig. 6.
Figure 6: Site groups for interleaved interaction. Sites in the group indexed “6”
are shaded.
Using the site groups and the preferential directions, molecular tr anslation
and collision are performed in an interleaved manner using the scheme shown
in Fig.7.

Figure 7: Interleaved paired site interaction scheme. Note Eq. ( 5) for the deﬁ-
nition of ∆.
For the interaction between paired neighboring sites iandj=pdi(i) in
Fig.7, we deﬁne a composite conditional permutation ψmtc, which represents
molecular translation and collision.
When both sites are vacuum, no interaction takes place:
mti=mtj= V⇒ψmtc(ωi,ωj) = (ωi,ωj) (identity). (10)
Wheniis occupied by a molecule and jis vacuum, the molecule at imoves
tojif the TKE in this direction pdiis positive, or the molecule’s TKE in
this direction is inverted if the TKE in the opposite direction is positive, or no
change takes place if the molecule’s TKEs are zero in both directions:

(11)
(Here, internal layers that are unaﬀected by ψmtcare omitted.) Conversely,
wheniis vacuum and jis occupied by a molecule, the molecule’s move direction
pdiis replaced by −pdiin the above equation. Note that if the preferential
directions are uniform over all of the sites, a free molecule without m olecular
interaction always maintains the directions of its TKEs after one full unit-time
update, because whenever an inversion of TKE takes place, it is can celed by
another inversion in the update scheme of Fig. 7. This does not hold, however,
if the preferential directions are not uniform. This issue will be addr essed again
in section 3.6.

3.4.2 Maintenance of molecular bonds
As mentioned earlier, polymers are composed as chains of monomers linked by
molecular bonds (Fig. 5). Integrated and coherent motion of such a multi-site
structure(“solidbody”) is diﬃcult to model usingCA. Apossibleappr oachis to
express the structure’s motion states by its deforming shape[ 24,25]. Although
this method can replicate many aspects of Hamiltonian mechanics as w ell as the
structure’s integrity, it makes it diﬃcult to formalize proper interac tion between
such a structure and the single-site particles (molecules) whose mo tion states
are expressed as their internal states. In the RLMA, the mainten ance of bonds
is ensured by using the bond information as another conditional sign al for the
molecular translational permutation ( 11).
First, it is checked if the molecular bonds (provided they exist) are m ain-
tained when the molecule at imoves to the vacuum site j=pdi(i). Bonds
with molecules at ∆±1(pdi)(i) are not destroyed by the movement because the
bonded molecules remain neighbors (the bond directions after move ment be-
come ∆±2(pdi); Fig.8(a)). If the molecule has bonds in other directions, these
bondsaredestroyedbythemovement(Fig. 8(b)). Therefore,weappendanother
condition to the permutation ( 11):

ψmtc(ωi,ωj) = (ωi,ωj) otherwise .
(13)
The readjustment of bonds ψbrtakes place not only at the moved molecule’s
new position jbut also at ∆±1(pdi)(i) if the bonds exist:
ψbr
mbj,∆+1(pdi),mbj,∆+2(pdi)

0,mb∆−1(pdi)(i),∆+2(pdi)
,
(14)
A drawback of this rule is that it occasionally causes motion of polymer s
that has less physical relevance. For example, when a polymer’s con stituent
monomers are arranged on a straight line and all of the monomers ha ve positive
TKE only on the line, the polymer cannot move even if all of the monome rs’
TKE directions are identical. However, if some of the monomers have posi-
tive TKEs in other directions, this polymer can move on average to its most
proper direction with respect to TKE, while becoming deformed and k eeping
its integrity.
12Figure 8: Translational movement and molecular bonds. If a molecule atiis
moving to j=pdi(i), (a) its bonds in directions ∆±1(pdi) are maintained with
their directions readjusted to ∆±2(pdi), but (b) bonds in directions ∆±2(pdi)
and−pdiwould not be maintained.
3.4.3 Self-organization and reversibility
In irreversible models such as the LMA, the tendency of self-organ ization from
disordered high-entropystates to ordered low-entropystruct ures is embedded in
their information-losing transition rules themselves. To realize “app arent” self-
organization of ordered structures by a reversible rule without inf ormation loss,
the rule needs additional degrees of freedom that work as a heat bath into which
the entropy generated in the organization process should be dispo sed of. The
deterministic Ising model[ 8] and the reversible generalization[ 9] of the diﬀusion
limited aggregation (DLA) model[ 26] are examples of this approach. We also
adopt this approach, using the heat particle layer as the heat bath.
When both of the neighboring sites iandjhave molecules, in advance of
the collision ( 12) byψmtc, we apply site-respective TKE–heat interaction ψth
deﬁned as follows. For the molecule at site x(i.e., either iorj), when it has
positive TKE in one direction lout of{±pdi}(i.e., along the line connecting the
two molecules), and when the heat particles satisfy hx,l<Hmaxandhx,−l= 0
at sitex, then the positive TKE is transformed into a heat particle in the same
directionl(heat release):

ψth(ωx) =ωx otherwise.
(15)
On the other hand, when the molecule at xdoes not have a TKE in either
of{±pdi}and heat particles exist in only one of the two directions, one heat
13particle is transformed into the TKE in the same direction (heat abso rption):

Introduction of this TKE–heat interaction makesthe interaction b etween neigh-
boring molecules non-elastic.
For molecular translation, potentials work as yet another control signal for
the permutation in ψmtcof Eq. (11), and the translation is executed only if the
changes in potentials entailed by the movement of molecule from itoj, given
that their neighbors are ﬁxed, can be compensated for by emission /absorption

Here,δ(−)Vi,l(i)represents the potential change in direction lcaused by remov-
ing the molecule from its current site i, andδ(+)Vj,l(j)represents a potential
change in direction lcaused by placing the molecule (while maintaining its ori-
entation) at vacuum site j. Further, when the translation is actually induced
by the permutation ( 11), it is followed by the potential change compensation

Thus, a molecule moving to a more stable site (/summationtext

heat particles in total, and it can be dissociated again from its neighbo rs only
when enough energy is supplied by the heat particle layer.
3.4.4 Rotation of polar molecules
Polar molecules such as water and hydrophilic monomers can take diﬀe rent po-
tential values depending on their orientations. According to the LM A rule, the
polar molecules are rotated irreversibly into their more stable (lower -potential)
orientations. Tomaintainreversibilityand atthe same time toenable r elaxation
into a more stable direction conﬁguration, we utilize RKE and also the h eat par-
ticle layer. Similar to the paired site interaction in Fig. 7, rotational update is
also performed in the interleaved scheme shown in Fig. 9. Here, we again use
the site groups of Eq. ( 9) (although for the rotational permutation given below,
interference can be prevented if the sites in each group are separ ated by more
than a unit distance).

The rotational update ρis deﬁned as follows: the polar molecule at irotates
according to the sign of RKE and the orientation becomes ∆rkei(moi) if the
change in potentials caused by the rotation can be compensated fo r by emis-
sion/absorption of heat particles at the site. Otherwise, the molec ule does not
rotate and RKE is inverted:

Here
δ(k,∆n)Vi,l(i)(20)
represents the potential change in direction lthat occurs when the orientation
of the molecule at iis changed from kto ∆n(k), with the neighboring molecules
ﬁxed.
In this rule, the RKEs work as a kind of “second-order” signal[ 10], which
preserves the history of the molecules’ rotational states. Ther efore, the polar
molecules cannot stop rotating i.e., rke/ne}ationslash= 0 (or given rke/ne}ationslash= 0 as the initial
condition, they cannot change their orientations forever). For a n alternative
rotation rule that allows RKEs to take values on Z, including the stationary
staterke= 0, see Appendix A.
3.4.5 Transportation of heat particles
For the heat particle layer to function as a heat bath, the released heat particles
should be eﬀectively diﬀused into open areas. In ourRLMA model, the diﬀusion
ofheat particlesis conducted bya rule similarto that forthe Frisch– Hasslacher–
Pomeau lattice gas automata (FHP-LGA)[ 13], that is, for every unit-time up-
date, a synchronous shift (translation) σhis performed in each direction

with 0<m≤Hmaxandk∈ {1,2,3}. Note that the collision φhis deterministic
and utilizes the parity of preferential direction at each site.
3.5 Composition of unit-time update
After integrating the sub-steps deﬁned above, a unit-time updat e of the RLMA
can be performed through the following time sub-steps (variables in parentheses
are those aﬀected by the particular sub-step):
1. Transportation of heat particles (( hi,l),pdi)
Heat particles are diﬀused by the FHP-LGA-like combination of the sh ift
(21) and collision ( 22).
2. Rotation of polar molecules ( mti,moi,rkei,(hi,l))
Using the interleaved scheme of Fig. 9, molecular rotation is performed by
the conditional permutation ( 19).
3. Moleculartranslationandinteraction( mti,moi,(tkei,l),(mbi,l),(hi,l),pdi)
Using the interleaved scheme of Fig. 7,
•molecular translation is performed by the paired site conditional per -
mutation ( 11) with the conditions ( 13) and (17), while
•molecular interaction is performed by the conditional permutation
(12) with the heat release ( 15) and absorption ( 16).
4. Update of preferential direction ( pdi)
To ensure unbiasedness for the principal directions, the prefere ntial direc-
tion should be updated according to time. We use the simple uniform
rotation pdi/mapsto→∆+1(pdi), although synchronous shifts and deterministic,
invertible pseudorandom number generators can also be combined.
Thesesub-stepsareindependent; therefore,theordercanbe changed. Eachsub-
time step is reversible; therefore, the inverse update is achieved b y performing
this construction in reverse.
3.6 Conservation laws
From the above deﬁnitions, the transition rule of RLMA conserves mass(num-
ber of molecules) and the total energy that is given as a sum of TKEs, RKEs,
16potential energies, and heat particles over the sites:
Etotal=/summationdisplay
i/summationdisplay
l∈Ltkei,l+/summationdisplay
i|rkei|+Vtotal+/summationdisplay
i/summationdisplay
l∈Lhi,l. (23)
These conservation laws enable precise application and validation of m ethods
and theoremsin statisticalmechanics, both equilibrium (microcanon ical, canon-
ical, and grand-canonical) and nonequilibrium ( e.g., relaxation, Fourier’s law of
heat conduction, Green–Kubo relations), as is done for simpler (an d in many
cases more abstract) CA models[ 8,9,27,28,29,30,31,32].
On the other hand, conservation of momenta does not hold becaus e of
the TKE inversion in the translational permutation ( 11), as mentioned in sec-
tion3.4.1. (Angular momenta are not conserved either, because the rotat ional
permutation ( 19) also contains uncompensated inversion of RKE.) From the
macroscopic viewpoint, this non-conservation of momenta seems t o work posi-
tively to enhance the model’s ergodicity, instead of the eﬀect of cha os dynamics,
which discrete CA models lack.
4 Simulation
In this section, we demonstrate by simulation that the RLMA can rep roduce
the original LMA’s self-organization results[ 3] as special cases. We also show
that the RLMA reproduces results which are qualitatively consisten t with the
traditional Larson-type models. More extensive results and their statistical
treatment will be given in a future work.
In the following simulations, the parameters are set as follows: Hmax= 8,
VWH−WH=VWO−WO=VWO−IP=VIP−IP= +4,VWH−WO=VWH−IP=−4,
VWH−WN=VWH−IN=VWH−O=VWO−WN=VWO−IN=VWO−O=VIP−WN=
VIP−IN=VIP−O=VO−O=−1. The simulations in section 4.1and4.2adopted
lattice space consisting of N= 24×24 cells, while the simulations in section 4.3
used lattice spaceof N= 100×100cells. Periodicboundarycondition is applied
in all the simulations, so the systems are isolated.
4.1 Hydrophobic monomers in a polar environment
Fig.10shows snapshots of the molecular layer in a simulation of a mixture of
waterandhydrophobicmonomers(25%water, 25%hydrophobicmo nomer, 50%
vacuum). Starting from a homogeneously mixed initial conﬁguration with no
heat particles (Fig. 10(a)), clustering and phase separation gradually take place
(Fig.10(b), (c)), accompanied by emission of heat particles (not shown in t he
ﬁgures).
Note also that phase separation takes place in spite of the setup th at the

4.2 Amphiphilic polymers in a polar environment
Fig.13shows snapshots of the molecular layer in three simulations of am-
phiphilic tetramers (each consisting of three hydrophilic monomers p lus one

for the initial distribution of heat particles.

ing the “low-temperature” condition (mean total energy per cell etotal= 0.95).
Although the low-temperature condition is the same as the one adop ted in the
simulation of Fig. 10, this simulation requires a longer relaxation time, because
the polymers’ mobility is lower than that of the monomers (mainly beca use of
the bond maintenance condition ( 13)). Starting from the initial condition where
the tetramers are homogeneously distributed, they aggregate in to micelle-like
structures, their hydrophilic heads staying in contact with water a nd their hy-
drophobic tails trying to cluster. The micelle-like structures are an e lementary

cess. That is, at lower temperature, polymers aggregate into larg er structures;
however, the formation process takes a longer time. On the other hand, at
higher temperature, large structures cannot be maintained while t he motion of
polymers gets faster. This kind of temperature dependency is der ived (rather
than being presupposed) in a precise manner only from dynamical mo dels with
reversibility and energy conservation. Fig. 15(especially (a)) also shows that
the aggregation of polymers is slower than the clustering of water.
4.3 Phase separation dynamics in ternary mixtures
To compare in more detail the behavior of our RLMA with experimenta l obser-
vations and other models (especially the Larson-type ones), we co nducted sim-
ulation of ternary mixtures of water, hydrophobic monomers, and amphiphilic
polymers, and analyzed the phase separation dynamics with diﬀeren t concen-
tration and temperature (total energy) settings.
Theories as well as successful models have shown that the phase s eparation
or domain growth dynamics generally obeys dynamic scaling[ 33,15,34,36,22],
where domain structure remains statistically invariant in time under r escaling
by the characteristic length scale L, andLgrows as a function of time following
the asymptotic power law, L(t)∼t1/z. The theories typically suggest z= 1/3,
though the value can diﬀer depending on the stages of phase separ ation.
To check if the RLMA realizesthe dynamic scaling behavior, we investig ated
the evolution of mean cluster radius . A molecule of type X(in this case, Xcan
be water W, hydrophobic monomer O, or amphiphile A) belongs to a clus ter
of typeXif any of its nearest neighbor are of the same type and are already
counted as part of the cluster. Using the cluster distribution {nX(s)}s, where
nX(s) is the number of type Xclusters with size s, the mean cluster size χXof

is observed for all the concentration ratios ( φW,φO,φA) = (0.288,0.288,0.024),
(0.27,0.27,0.06), and (0 .24,0.24,0.12). For each setting, the scaling exponent
1/zis estimated as 0 .213±0.004, 0.199±0.005, and 0.121±0.004, by ﬁtting
the data within time region [10000 ,200000]into /an}bracketle{tR/an}bracketri}ht(t)∼t1/z. These estimated
values, especially the former two (1 /z∼0.2) are similar to the ones obtained
by simpler Ising spin models for binary systems [ 34,35,36], but smaller than
the theoretical value z= 1/3 which is also obtained in Ref. [ 22] by adding small
amount of amphiphile into binary mixture, like in this simulation. The small
values are possibly because the asymptotic late stage is not reache d due to the
small size of the system, but other possible reasons can be also sug gested: (i)
the existence of hydrodynamics, which is supposed to be absent in t he dynamic
scaling hypothesis[ 33] as well as the Larson-type model in Ref. [ 22], (ii) the
constant-energy condition, where the temperature increases a s the clustering
proceeds and the dynamic exponent becomes smaller compared to t he isother-
mal condition[ 15], while the latter is usually used in the Larson-type models
and other Monte Carlo methods, and (iii) other conservation laws, w hich also
work to decrease the exponent [ 36]. The decrease in the growth rate of /an}bracketle{tR/an}bracketri}ht

develops a peak at nonzero wave number that grows in time and the p osition

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we described the construction of RLMA, which simulat es physico-
chemical interaction of molecules and their self-organization proce ss. The deﬁ-
nition of the model has shown how to eliminate the irreversibility in the o riginal
LMA using several techniques to construct reversible CA. Simulatio n results of
RLMA dynamics have demonstrated that the RLMA can deal with bro ader sit-
uations, with the original LMA’s self-organization results as special cases. The
results also showed that the RLMA reproduces qualitatively consist ent results
with the traditional Larson-type models.
Although several reversible CA models have been proposed to simula te self-
organization processes[ 8,9], to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst deterministic CA
model that simulates self-organization of higher-order structures, while satisfy-
ing strict reversibility.
Reversibility and conservation laws of the model enable precise applic ation
and validation of the various methods in both equilibrium and nonequilibr ium
statistical mechanics. Reversibility also enables rigorous tracking o f the infor-
mation ﬂow driven by the dynamics, with no veiled sources or sinks. Th erefore,
24the model will be preferable in analyzing the self-organization and dy namics
of multiple levels of structures from a information-theoretic viewpo int (e.g.,
Ref. [2]), as well as from the physically grounded viewpoint.
Thisstudyfocusedontheprocessofmolecularassembly. However ,themodel
canbe extendedtoincorporatechemicalreactionsandcatalytice ﬀects, byintro-
ducing more types of molecules and setting proper values of excitat ion energies
for the reactions, with their modulation in the existence of neighbor ing catalytic
molecules. We are currently working on the construction of such a r eversible
and thermodynamically consistent model that realizes “protocells” [6] with self-
maintenance of compartment structures, metabolism, and self-r eproduction.

A Alternative implementation of molecular ro-
tation
Here, we present an alternative rotation rule, which enables the st ationary state
rke= 0forthe polarmolecules. Using the sameinterleavedschemeofFig. 9, the
rotational permutation ρof (19) is replaced by the new conditional permutation
ρadeﬁned below.
First, consider that a polar molecule at iis rotating, i.e., rkei/ne}ationslash= 0. Then, ρa
maintains the rotation and changes the molecule’s orientation by ∆sgn(rkei)3if
the magnitude of rkeiis more than suﬃcient to compensate for the change in
potential induced by the rotation; else, it inverts the direction of r otation if the
magnitude of rkeiis not large enough. If the magnitude of rkeiis just suﬃcient
to compensate for the potential change, ρaeither executes the rotation and
brings the molecule to the stationary state, or inverts the directio n of rotation,

rotation.

(27)
Next, consider that a polar molecule at iis in the stationary state, i.e.,
rkei= 0. Then, ρastarts the rotation if changing the molecule’s orientation by
one of the directions ∆±1induces a negative potential change. If rotations in
both of the directions ∆±1induce negative potential changes, ρastarts the rota-
tion according to the preferential direction. On the other hand, if the molecule’s
orientation is at a local potential minimum, the molecule maintains its st ation-
ary state:

represents the total potential change at ithat occurs when the orientation of
the molecule at iis changed from kto ∆n(k) (see the notation ( 20), too).
The main point is that, in ρa, change in RKE and not heat compensates for
the change in potential. Therefore, the RKE layer can work as anot her energy
storage. Recall that in the rotation rule ( 19), RKE worksjust as “second-order”
signals to preserve reversibility; hence, it cannot change to 0. It s hould also be
noted that the parity ( 7) of the preferential direction is utilized to avoid non-
26uniqueness of the ρa’s pre-images, which could be derived from unstable ﬁxed
points (stationary states at orientations of local maximum potent ial).
One drawback of this alternative rotation rule is that the value of RK E is
unbounded in principle; thus, the model is not a CA in the strict sense . In
practice, however, due to the energy conservation ( 23), limitless divergence of
RKE cannot occur unless an inﬁnite amount of energy is injected into a ﬁnite
region.
The RLMA model with the alternative rotation permutation ρashows quali-
tativelysimilar behavior. Fig. 18showssnapshotsofthe molecularlayer, Fig. 19
shows the time evolution of mean energies per cell, and Fig. 20shows the time
evolution of mean numbers of neighboring molecules of the same type s in a
simulation of a water–hydrophobic monomer system, with the same in itial con-
ﬁguration as that in section 4.1.

hydrophobicmonomer system, using the alternative rotationrule ρa. Clustering
and phase separation occur in a similar manner to those shown in Fig. 10.
