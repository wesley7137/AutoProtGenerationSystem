Title: Co-delivery of protopanaxatriol/icariin into niche cells restores bone marrow niches to rejuvenate HSCs for chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.
Abstract: Up to 80 % of chemotherapeutic drugs induce myelosuppression in patients. Chemotherapy not only impairs of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) but also damages bone marrow niches (vascular and endosteal). Current treatments for myelosuppression overlook these chemotherapy-induced damages to bone marrow niches and the critical role of niche restoration on hematopoietic regeneration. Ginsenoside protopanaxatriol (PPT) protects vascular endothelium from injury, while icariin (ICA) promotes osteogenic differentiation. The combination of PPT and ICA aims to restore damaged vascular and endosteal niches, thus rejuvenating HSCs for treating myelosuppression.
