Title: Cellular forgetting, desensitisation, stress and aging in signalling
  networks. When do cells refuse to learn more?
Abstract:   Recent findings show that single, non-neuronal cells are also able to learn
signalling responses developing cellular memory. In cellular learning nodes of
signalling networks strengthen their interactions e.g. by the conformational
memory of intrinsically disordered proteins, protein translocation, miRNAs,
lncRNAs, chromatin memory and signalling cascades. This can be described by a
generalized, unicellular Hebbian learning process, where those signalling
connections, which participate in learning, become stronger. Here we review
those scenarios, where cellular signalling is not only repeated in a few times
(when learning occurs), but becomes too frequent, too large, or too complex and
overloads the cell. This leads to desensitisation of signalling networks by
decoupling signalling components, receptor internalization, and consequent
downregulation. These molecular processes are examples of anti-Hebbian learning
and forgetting of signalling networks. Stress can be perceived as signalling
overload inducing the desensitisation of signalling pathways. Aging occurs by
the summative effects of cumulative stress downregulating signalling. We
propose that cellular learning desensitisation, stress and aging may be placed
along the same axis of more and more intensive (prolonged or repeated)
signalling. We discuss how cells might discriminate between repeated and
unexpected signals, and highlight the Hebbian and anti-Hebbian mechanisms
behind the fold-change detection in the NF-\k{appa}B signalling pathway. We
list drug design methods using Hebbian learning (such as chemically-induced
proximity) and clinical treatment modalities inducing (cancer, drug allergies)
desensitisation or avoiding drug-induced desensitisation. A better
discrimination between cellular learning, desensitisation and stress may open
novel directions in drug design, e.g., helping to overcome drug-resistance.

Abstract  
Recent findings show that single,  non-neuronal cells are also a ble to learn signalling 
responses developing cellular memory. In cellular learning node s of signalling networks 
strengthen their interactions  e.g. by the conformational memory  of intrinsically disordered 
proteins, protein translocation, m iRNAs, lncRNAs, chromatin mem ory and signalling 
cascades. This can be described by a generalized, unicellular H ebbian learning process, where 
those signalling connections, whi ch participate in learning, be come stronger. Here we review 
those scenarios, whe re cellular signalling is not only repeated  in a few times (when learning 
occurs), but becomes too frequent , too large, or too complex an d overloads the cell. This leads 
to desensitisation of signalli ng networks by decoupling signall ing components, receptor 
internalization, and consequent dow nregulation. These molecular  processes are examples of 
anti-Hebbian learning and ‘forg etting’ of signalling networks. Stress can be perceived as 
signalling overload inducing the  desensitisation of signalling pathways. Aging occurs by the 
summative effects of cumulativ e stress downregulating signallin g. We propose that cellular 
learning desensitisation, stress and aging may be placed along the same axis of more and 
more intensive (prolonged or repeated) signalling. We discuss h ow cells might discriminate 
between repeated and unexpected s ignals, and highlight the Hebb ian and anti-Hebbian 
mechanisms behind the fold- change detection in the NF- κB signalling pathway. We list drug 
design methods using Hebbian lear ning (such as chemically-induc ed proximity) and clinical 
treatment modalities inducing (cancer, drug allergies) desensit isation or avoiding drug- 
induced desensitisation. A better  discrimination between cellul ar learning, dese nsitisation and 
stress may open novel direc tions in drug design, e.g., helping to overcome drug-resistance.

Learning of signalling networks  – at the level of their compone nts 
 
Molecular mechanisms of neurona l learning became well establish ed [1]. However, much less 
is known about the regulation of l earning at the individual, no n-neuronal cells. Recent 
findings gave further evidence th at learning, indeed occurs in unicellular organisms, as well as 
in individual cells of various ti ssues other than neurons, even  in rather sophisticated forms [2]. 
In our paper we define cellular learning as an adaptive respons e to a stimulus, when the 
stimulus is repeated in a short time. This leaves out many clas sical models of learning (such 
as Pavlovian conditional learni ng) from our discussion. However , such a simplification 
greatly helps the identification  of molecular mechanisms, which  become increasingly

differentiation or tumour development. Several experiments in b udding yeast, Arabidopsis or 
rice cells, mouse fibroblasts or murine CD8+ memory cells showed the formation of 
molecular memory resulting in a f aster, larger, more sensitive and/or more robust response 
after the second signal than the first [3-9]. 
 
Various molecular mechanisms i nduce a faster and stronger respo nse after a repeated signal in 
single cells. We mentio n the conformational memory of intrinsic ally disordered proteins 
(IDPs) first, where the IDP transiently keeps its ordered confo rmation acquired a fter the first 
signal, and if the second signal arrives within the time window  of the IDPs relaxation back to 
the disordered state, than the second signal finds the IDP in a  ‘conformationally-primed’, 
‘memory’-state [10,11]. IDPs may act like mo lecular switches ch anging the direction of 
signal transmission [ 12]. Prions are an imp ortant class of IDPs . Prion proteins may transform 
themselves to a β-sheet enriche d prion form, which forms aggreg ates. In budding yeast cells 
the prion form of Pin1 maintain ed the molecular memory of a pre vious heat shock for many 
generations [4]. Oligomerizing p roteins involved in cellular me mory formation were called as 
mnemons [13,14]. In case of the W hi3 protein present in yeast m nemon and prion states were 
shown to be associated, which conf ines the memory of deceptive courtship to the mother cell 
[15]. Increased association of ‘c onformationally-primed’ IDPs w ith their signalling partners 
can be regarded as an increased  network edge weight of signalli ng networks [10,16]. 
 
Signal-induced protein transloca tion (e.g. between the cytoplas m and the mitochondria or cell 
nucleus) is a widespread phenomenon in the cell potentially inv olving thousands of human 
proteins [17]. Nuclear residence time of the yeast cyclin Cln3 finely tunes Whi5 inactivation 
by phosphorylation. Whi5 is re-activ ated rapidly with a half-ti me of ~12 min. Thus the 
Cln3/Whi5 system provides a rapi dly changing short term memory of environmental nutrient 
levels for yeast cells [18]. Mito chondrial translocation of the  adaptor protein p66SHC was 
associated with the formation of  hyperglycaemic cellular memory  of human aortic endothelial 
cells [19]. Conversely, inhibition of  nuclear translocation of NK-κB p65 disrupted the 
formation of CD8+ memory T and memory B cells [ 20,21]. Translocati ng proteins bui ld a 
number of new connections in si gnalling networks, which, again,  shows a large increase of all 
signalling network edge weights involved. 
 
MicroRNAs are involved both in sensitisation- and habituation-t ype cellular memory 
formation. MiRNA-156 participated  in the molecular memory forma tion of previous heat 
shock in Arabidopsis cells lasting for seve ral days [6]. As an additional example fo r 
sensitisation, miRNA-21 preserved  the fibrotic m echanical memor y of mesenchymal stem 
cells [22]. As an example of ha bituation, both miRNA-221 and mi RNA-222 were involved in 
the memory development of lipopolysaccharide tolerance [23]. Lo ng non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) played an important role in the memory formation of r ice cells after drought stress 
[7] and the formation of CD8+ memory T cells after lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus 
infection [24]. Increased miRNA and lncRNA levels correspond to  increased network edge 
weights of miRNA connections in signalling networks. 
 
Learning of signalling netwo rks – at the network level  
 
After the contribution of single macromolecules (proteins and R NAs) to the formation of 
cellular memory, we give additional three examples of more comp lex, system-level, 
signalling network-type adaptati on. The first example is that o f epigenetic mechanisms and 
chromatin memory [25]. A large variety of histone modifications  and DNA methylation 3  constitute transcriptional memory. Histone H3 lysine methylatio n was shown to participate in 
the cellular memory development of yeast [26], Arabidopsis [5] (specifically m ediated by heat 
shock factors HSFA2 and HSFA3; 27 ], mouse fibroblast and HeLa c ell sensitisation to IFN-β 
and -γ, respectively [8,28], as well as in CD8+ memory T cell formation [9]. DNA 
methylation pattern of 132 genes we re changed in the developmen t of CD4+ memory T cells 
[29]. CRISPRoff, a single dead Cas9 fusion protein establishes DNA methylation and 
repressive histone m odifications providing a  genome-wide transc riptional memory [30]. 
Several studies showed the involvement of three-dimensional chr omatin structure 
reorganization during cellular me mory development in yeast [3,3 1], as well as in the 
sensitisation to repeated IFN-γ t reatment of HeLa cells [28] by  the same, nuclear pore protein 
100/98-mediated chromatin-reorganization process [32]. 
 
The second example of  network-type cellular memory formation is  that of signalling protein 
kinase cascades. Members of t he Hog1 signalling pathway of osmo tic stress in yeast remained 
phosphorylated even after  minutes of the first stress, and ‘wai ted’ pre-activated for a faster 
response to a potential repeated  stress [33]. Similarly, in the  mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) cascade different relaxat ion rates of individual compone nts developed an 
‘activation-competent’ state i nducing post-activation protein p hosphorylation bursts [34]. 
MAPK pathway members are organized by pathway scaffold proteins  from fungi (e.g. Far1- 
and Ste5-like proteins [35]) to h umans (e.g. RACK1 [36]). These  proteins, once they became 
activated, maintain larger pathw ay segments pre-organized, read y to respond to the second 
stimulus faster, and stronger. We note that similar signalling cascade memories may be 
postulated in each signalling pathw ay. As examples the JNK and Hippo pathway cascades are 
enhanced by the scaffolding prote ins JIP1 and MOB1A, respective ly [37,38]. These scaffolds 
may prime these pathways givi ng a stronger second response afte r an initial stimulus. 
 
The third example expands the a bove idea of path way organizatio n and consequent cellular 
memory formation to networks oth er than signalling networks, su ch as metabolic networks. 
Analysis of non-Markovian chemi cal reaction networks on gene ex pression showed that 
molecular memory of protein synt hesis and degradation may induc e feedback, bimodality and 
switch behaviour, and may fine t une gene expression noise, all components of molecular 
memory [39]. Even bacteria use th eir inner membrane as a scaffo ld [40], as well as bacterial 
microcompartments [41] to enhan ce the metabolic flux of their e nzymes. Mitochondria and 
other intracellular compartments  also function as eukaryotic or ganizers of metabolic 
processes [42]. Metabolons are m ultienzyme complexes that are h eld together by noncovalent 
interactions enhancing their cooperation and summative metaboli c flux by substrate 
channelling in e.g. glycolysis , branched chain amino acid oxida tion, purine biosynthesis, etc. 
[43–47]. All these bacterial, m itochondrial and cellular microc ompartmental metabolic 
scaffolds, as well as metabolons are potential organizers of ce llular memory. 
 
Hebbian learning of signalling networks  
 
Practically all molecular mechan isms of cellular memory formati on mentioned above are 
satisfying the basic concept of Hebbian learning, i.e.: the inc rease of the connection strength 
of those learning components (i n the initial concept: neurons) which are involved in the 
learning process [1,48]. Stronger an d faster binding of 'confor mationally primed' IDPs, prions 
and mnemons, protein transloca tion, overexpression of miRNAs an d lncRNAs, chromatin 
memory, scaffolded protein kinase  and metabolic pathways are al l examples of connection 
strength increases after an ini tial signal – ser ving as potenti al learning mechanisms of non- 
neuronal single cells (Fig 1). 4  Obviously, single cells can not e xpress the complexity of the l earning process of multicellular 
networks. This is especially tru e to that of neuronal networks.  One simple reason of this is the 
number of connections. While m acromolecules may bind only handf ul of other 
macromolecules, neurons devel oped axons and dendrites, which (b y their tremendously 
increased surface areas) allow their connections to tens of tho usands of other neurons. This by 
itself already magnifies  the structural complexity which may be  achieved by neuronal 
networks, and allows the developm ent of incomparably more sophi sticated learning processes 
than those of singl e, non-neuronal cells. 
 
Anti-Hebbian learning in non-neuronal cells  
 
Hebbian learning needs to be compl emented by the reverse proces s, where connection 
strengths decrease, since only He bbian-type ‘positive’ changes of the system would lead to 
the system’s over-excitation. Thi s was first generally formaliz ed by Oja’s rule, which keeps 
the total of connection strengt hs constant duri ng a Hebbian lea rning process [49]. In cells 
connection strength decrease (d ecay) is generall y introduced by  cellular noise [50]. However, 
anti-Hebbian learning may also d ecrease the strength of specifi c connections, such as the 
reduced expression of the STL1 sugar transporter gene in budding yeast cells after 
hyperosmotic stress [31], th e diminished response of MYC -dependent genes after repeated 
dehydration stress in Arabidopsis [51] and the imm une tolerance of macrophages after 
repeated lipopolysaccharide exposure [23]. Several of these dir ect, anti-Hebbian molecular 
mechanisms lead to habituation, whe re the cell displays a decre ased response to repeated 
stimulation. Biological pathway network models were able to dis play both sensitisation 
(Hebbian) and habituation (an ti-Hebbian) behaviour [52]. 
 
Cellular memory and forgetting  
 
As first suggested by Françoi s Jacob and Jacques Monod in 1961 [53], individual cells also 
have a memory, i.e. the  persistence of a ce llular state, which is acquired after a stimulus. 
Cellular memory allows the estab lishment and maintenance of the  identity of individual cells 
in heterogeneous cellular populati ons. Memory of the cells is m anifested by bistable feedback 
loops or epigenetic marks confe rring hysteresis and simple cogn itive functions to cellular 
behaviour [25,54,55]. Intertwined  feedback loops reduce cellula r noise [50] and induce 
hysteresis, since stabilization of the ‘signalling-on’ state cr eates a resistance to return to the 
initial, ‘signalling-off’ state . While simple, hysteresis-type memory can be maintained by self- 
sustaining feedback loops, there  seems to be a minimal network size requirement  of at least 5 
nodes to display richer me mory functions [52]. 
 
Forgetting of organisms such as C. elegans is induced by cellular mechanisms, like the 
Musashi, MSI1-induced  down-regulation of t he ARP2/3 complex (pl aying a major role in the 
organization of the cytoskelet on) [56]. Increased cellular nois e is a key factor of ‘forgetting’ 
in single, non-neuronal cells [50] . As a more specific example for the effect of cellular noise, 
robustness of the MAPK pathway b ecomes reduced, if environmenta l fluctuations (extrinsic 
noise) or variances of inherent chemical reaction rates (intrin sic noise) grow beyond a certain 
threshold [57]. 
 
We list three examples, where individual molecular mechanisms a re involved in cellular 
‘forgetting’. First, erasure o f DNA-methylation is meditated by  ten-eleven translocation 
(TET) DNA-demethylases [58] . Second, the long noncoding RNA, or iginating at –2700 5  upstream of the budding yeast HO endonuclease, erased previous molecular memory of 
nutrient deprivation- or pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest [5 9]. Third, molecular 
chaperones may help the disorga nization of protein sequences, t hus they may act as 
facilitators of both molecular me mory formation and cellular ‘f orgetting’ [60]. However, 
currently beyond these mechan isms we do not know enough about t he molecular systems 
regulating ‘forgetting’ in individual, non-neuronal cells. 
 
We note that anti-Hebbian learni ng diminishes the strength of c ertain molecular connections, 
while cellular ‘forgetting’ may  also induce a more general decr ease of connection strengths. 
However, there is an obvious overl ap between the two phenomena.  
 
Desensitisation of signalling networks  
 
Desensitisation of signalling responses is a general, habituati on-type regulatory mechanism of 
signalling pathways. The most wid espread way of desensitisation  is receptor down-regulation 
by internalization ( many times involving a utophagy) and consequ ent degradation. We list 
here only a few examples of the m any: the key plant stress sign alling hormone, abscisic acid 
is desensitised by numerous steps  of directed protein degradati on [61]. An early example was 
the desensitisation of protein k inase C by its nonmetabolizable , long-term agonist, phorbol 
ester [62]. 
 
As an archetype of desensitisation G-protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR) kinases (GRKs) 
induce arrestin binding to GPCRs,  dissociating G-proteins and l eading to GPCR 
internalization [63,64]. While shor t term activation of GPCRs c auses receptor desensitisation 
via β-arrestin-mediated decoupli ng from G proteins, long-term (hour s to days) activation 
induces receptor down-regulati on by internalization into vesicl es, lysosomal degradation and 
decrease of receptor mRNAs [65].  The GPCR cardiac β-adrenorecep tors became 
downregulated after prolonged in vivo infusion of catecholamines  in rat [66]. GPCR α1- 
adrenoreceptors could be downregul ated by the specific α1 agoni st, R-(-)-N6-(2- 
phenylisopropyl)adenosine in r at atria inducing their uncouplin g from G proteins and loss of 
Gi proteins [67]. Desensitisation of  rat heart contractility after  sustained adenosine treatment 
seems to be mediated by the α1- adrenoreceptor and protein kinas e C [68]. 
 
Continuous exposure of rat pancr eatic islets to high glucose (3 00 mg/dl) induced glucose 
hypersensitivity after 3 hours wh ich turned to glucose insensit ivity after 6 hours of exposure 
[69]. Insulin receptor auto-anti bodies (as agents able to provo ke a sustained activation) 
induced an insulin-resistant sta te of glucose metabolism in 3T3 -L1 adipocyte-like fatty 
fibroblasts after 6 hours of exp osure blocking a n early step in  insulin signalling (but leaving 
insulin binding ability constant) [70]. 
 
Signalling of human cells is not m ore complex than that of e.g.  Caenorhabditis elegans or 
Drosophila melanogaster because of more human signalling pathways, but b ecause of much 
more cross-talks between signalling pathways in humans [71]. Du e to this complexity 
desensitisation may often act on d ifferent pathways than that o f the provoking agent. 
Signalling pathways often act as ‘Darwinian competitors’. If on e of them becomes stronger 
(e.g. by a cellular learning proce ss), it induces molecular eve nts (such as protein 
phosphorylation), which desensitis e (inhibit, down-regulate, et c.) of ‘competing’ pathways. 
An example for this from the m any is the heterologous desensiti sation of G-protein coupled 
receptor (GPCR) and insulin-like growth factor pathways by insu lin [72]. Conversely, chronic 
endothelin exposure desensitises  the insulin pathway [73]. 6  Stress-induced desensitisation of signalling  
 
Desensitisation of a wide range of  signals is occurring, if the  cell or the animal experiences 
stress, such as heat shock, UV light, immob ilization, or endopl asmic reticulum stress. 
Immobilization reduced the numbe r of α1- and β-adrenoreceptors in rat hearts [74]. In 
agreement with the  internalization degradation sequence, imm obilization stress first 
reduced the number of surface β-adrenoreceptors, and only then the total number of receptors 
[75]. Suppression of microRNA-16 g ave a protection against acut e myocardial infarction 
reversing β2-adrenergic receptor downregulation in rats [76]. E pidermal growth factor (EGF) 
receptor down-regulation was obs erved in the colon cancer cell lines SW480, HT29, and 
DLD-1 after ultraviolet light-C t reatment inhibiting cell proli feration and survival [77]. UV 
light induced EGF, tumour necrosis  factor (TNF) and interleukin -1 receptor down-regulation 
in mammalian cells activating the Jun-kinase cascade [78]. 
 
Insulin signalling desensitisa tion potentially leads to diabete s. Insulin receptor tyrosine 
phosphorylation was reduced by tuni camycin-provoked endoplasmic  reticulum stress, which 
was reversed by the overexpression of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key signal of 
endoplasmic reticulu m stress [79]. Sim ilar, autophagy (but not proteasome) dependent down 
regulation of insulin signalli ng was observed after endoplasmic  reticulum stress in fat tissue 
of obese human subjects and 3T3-L 1 adipocytes [80]. Heat stress  downregulated insulin 
signalling in pig testicular cells [81]. 
 
Aging-induced signalling desensitisation  
 
Aging can be perceived as a cumul ative result of the continuous  stress by free radicals and 
other harmful effect s inducing inflammati on [82–86]. Aging is d ownregulating the renin- 
angiotensin system in rat kidneys  [87]. Klotho-induced activati on of the retinoic acid- 
inducible gene I/nucle ar factor-κB (RIG-I/NF-κB) signalling pat hway, as well as the 
subsequent production o f proinflammatory me diators (tumour necr osis factor α and 
interleukin-6) and inducible nitri c oxide synthase were reduced  in the kidneys of aged 
senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8  (SAMP8) mice [88]. Downreg ulation of angiogenesis- 
related vascular endothelial grow th factor (VEGF) signalling wa s reported in hearts of aging 
rats living a sedenta ry lifestyle, but was recovered in aging r ats with exercise training [89]. 
Endoplasmic reticulum stress was activated in fatty livers of o ld mice by inhibiting hepatocyte 
nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α) a nd downregulating farnesoid X r eceptor (FXR) [90]. 
Desensitisation of insulin recepto r growth factor (in particula r: downregulation of Irs1 and 
upregulation of Let-7 microRNA expression) was shown as a hallm ark of the aged phenotype 
in developing B lymphocytes by a g enome organization and chroma tin study. These changes 
were associated with specific a lterations in histone H3K27me3 o ccupancy, suggesting that 
Polycomb-mediated repr ession plays a role in precursor B cell a ging [91]. 
 
Learning, desensitisation, stre ss and aging in system-level sig nalling: phases of the same 
response?  
 
There are only a few reports of  time-dependent changes in cellu lar signalling upon shorter 
versus longer extracellular signals. One  of these was made on rat panc reatic islets, where 300 
mg/dl, high concentrations of extracellular glucose induced a s tronger response after 3 hours, 
which turned to glucose insensi tivity after 6 hours [69]. This is clearly a two-step cellular 
response, where the pancreatic b eta-cells first learned the pre sence of glucose and made a 7  preconditioned, stronger response t o them. However , after a lon ger time, an overload occurred 
and the cells turned to insens itive to glucose. Note that under  natural conditions high glucose 
is only a temporary, postprandial event. A similar effect was o bserved, when 3T3-L1 cultured 
fat cells were exposed to insulin receptor auto-antibodies. Acu te administration of anti- 
receptor antibodies induced a more efficient deoxyglucose uptak e, while prolonged exposure 
led to insulin insensitivity [92 ]. Here again, high levels of t he original agonist, insulin are also 
only transient, postprandial events. 
 
If we take the examples of 1.) cellular learning and developmen t of cellular memory after a 
few repeated stimuli [10,25,54,55];  2.) the desensitisation of signalling after a prolonged 
exposure to the signal [61–70] a nd 3.) the result of the above studies [69,92] (where in an 
extended timescale first learning and then desensitisation was observed) together, the 
conclusion can be drawn that, i n fact, cellula r learning and de sensitisation may be consequent 
phases of the same response. The c ell first becomes more ‘alert ’ and more ‘ready’ to respond 
to environmental changes. Howev er, after a prol onged stimulus i ts signalling network 
becomes ‘saturated’ and starts  to ‘protect its elf’ (Fig. 2). We  may also add stress [74–81] and 
aging [82–91] to this spectrum, whe re ‘fatigue’ of the signalli ng network is induced by both 
as examples of overloading short term (stress) and long-term (a ging) changes (Fig. 2). We 
note that comparative studies of  agonist-, stress- and aging-in duced desensitisation are 
missing. Therefore their comb ination on Fig. 2 is only illustra tive and hypothetical. 
 
Discrimination between repeated and unexpected signals: perhaps  as also a property of 
single cells?  
 
Desensitisation protects the s ystem from the overload of inputs . At a low level of complexity 
overload can be understood that too many of the same signal wit hin a certain time (where the 
system may adjust its thresholds  defining the “to o many” and th e “within a certain time”). At 
a higher level of complexity ove rload also occurs, if the syste m is not able to make ‘groups’ 
of similar input patterns. In f act, our brain defines objects ( features, categories, concepts, etc.) 
as groups of correlating ‘suspici ous coincidences’. Moreover, r ecognition of (and reduced 
response to) similar input pa tterns helps to highlight unexpect ed signals, which is essential for 
survival. If a layer of Hebbi an learning units becomes connecte d by modifiable anti-Hebbian 
feed-backs, the resulting system  is able to learn this discrimi nation and to recognize other 
principal components of an incom ing, complex signal than only i ts first principal component 
[93,94]. A well-known biological ex ample is that of the mormyri d electric fish, which is able 
to eliminate predictable inputs produced by its own, regular mo tor output. However, this 
response is a general feature of  cerebellum-like, laminar struc tures, where anti-Hebbian 
outputs of a deeper layer modulat e outer layers (Fig. 3A) [95].  Thus using anti-Hebbian 
learning prevents excessive noise  (i.e. regular, correlating, e xpected input) from masking 
important (i.e. unexpected) sensor y information. Most sensory s ystems work based on the 
principle of fold-ch ange detection, which allows for a proporti onal response to the fold- 
change of a signal (the unexpect ed) relative to the background (the repeated) [96]. From the 
complexity of learning responses  of non-neuronal single cells [ 2] and the presence of 
distributed decision making in cellular signalling [97], we may  expect that the widespread 
occurrence of anti-Hebbian learning in signalling networks (see  examples above) is involved 
in the discrimination between repeated and unexpected signals i n single, non-neuronal cells, 
too. Horizontal activation at a r eceptor-proximal level, as wel l as mutual inhibition at a 
receptor-distant level in signalli ng networks also point toward  this expectation. For instance, 
in the TNF-induced NF- κB signalling, the well-studied upstream crosstalk conveyed by 
TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) acts as horizontal activation a t the receptor proximal level 8  [98]. While downstream, a networ k motif containing inhibition h as been described that can 
impart fold-change detection to cell signalling c ircuits: the i ncoherent type-1 feedforward 
loop (I1-FFL) (Fig. 3B) [96, 99, 100] . I1-FFL is one of the mos t frequently occurring network 
motifs in transcriptional networ ks [101]. Besides fold-change d etection, I1-FFLs have a role 
in response acceleration even in y east [102]. In an I1-FFL, X u pregulates Y, while it also 
upregulates Z, a repressor of Y . This indirect repression of Y,  coupled with the direct 
activation of Y, can be considered  an anti-Hebbian learning mec hanism. Besides NF- κB 
signalling, I1-FFLs were also sugge sted to enable fold-change d etection in the  nuclear levels 
of the transcription factors of t ransforming growth factor beta  (TGF-β) signalling, explaining 
how the cells are able to give the same proportional response, even though the nuclear level of 
transcription factors can vary g reatly from cell to cell [96]. The occurrence of I1-FFLs in 
major signalling pathways suggest s that this learning mechanism  may be a rather general 
feature of signalling networks . Even still, to decide whether d iscrimination between repeated 
and unexpected signals is also a  property of single cells, futu re experiments are required. 
 
Applications of cellular learni ng and ‘forgetting’ in pharmacol ogy and drug design  
 
Mimicking cellular learning (memo ry) became a recent hit in dru g design. Chemically 
induced proximity between two a djacent signalling proteins (a n ew drug design paradigm 
[103,104]) is actually copying Hebbi an learning of the cell [10 ]. In this ‘cellular learning 
scenario’ chemical proximity-d eveloping drugs i nduce targeted p osttranslational 
modifications of key, otherwise  undruggable proteins. In the re versed, anti-Hebbian learning 
model, chemically induced proximi ty promotes the selective degr adation of the target 
[105,106]. 
 
Drug resistance can be conceptua lised in a learning network mod el as habituation. Biological 
networks may contain nodes, where  stimulation breaks the habitu ation (drug resistance) 
developed by the network [52]. L imited drug tolerance can be co nceptualised as sensitisation 
in a learning network model, most simply by displaying a hyster esis-type response. 
Interestingly, breaking of sensitis ation was much rarer phenome non in a model of 35 
biological networks than that of  habituation [52]. However, the  break of allergy-induced 
sensitisation against drugs beca me a carefully manageable clini cal modality in the last 
decades – as we will describe in the following paragraphs. 
 
Signal desensitisation plays a majo r role in anti-cancer therap y, which can be regarded as ‘the 
archetype’ of therapeutic intervention consequences in a number  of other diseases. As an 
example for the first modality of  protocols, the anti-cancer ag ent, 90 kDa heat shock protein 
(Hsp90) inhibitors induce a dese nsitisation of the EGF receptor  via p38 MAPK mediated 
phosphorylation at Ser1046/1047 of t he EGF receptor in human pa ncreatic cancer cells. Here 
drug-induced desensitisation of the cancer-promoting growth fac tor signal is a mode of action 
to avoid disease [105]. As an exa mple for the second modality o f consequences, gastric 
cancer cells become desensitised t o trastuzumab-treatment by up regulation of MUC4 
expression and by catecholamine-i nduced β2-adrenoreceptor activ ation. Here desensitisation, 
i.e. the development of drug r esistance is an unwanted conseque nce of drug treatment [106]. 
As a third modality of therapeutic interventions, response-dese nsitisation (i.e . breaking the 
sensitisation of unwanted side-r eactions for the d rug) is a gen eral goal in cancer therapy, 
where patients often develop sensitivity towards the administer ed drugs [107,108]. 
 
Supporting the notion that can cer therapy experiences are ‘ pars pro toto ’ for other conditions, 
increased hypersensitivity to  drugs (e.g. for aspirin and non-s teroid anti-inflammatory drugs, 9  NSAIDs in patients with heart dise ase or inflammatory diseases;  for insulins, penicillin or 
other antibiotics) became a gene ral phenomenon in the past 25 y ears due to the widespread 
and intensive drug use. T herefore, carefully administered drug- desensitisation protocols 
became more and more important i n the clinical  practice [109,11 0]. Similarly, drug induced 
desensitisation of cellular mech anisms of action is also a gene ral phenomenon in a number of 
non-cancer treatment protocols, i ncluding that of β-adrenergic agonists in asthma [111], 
diabetes [112,113] or he art failure [114]. 
 
Conclusions  
 
In our previous work [10] we gave several examples for cellular  learning [3–9] (i.e. the 
formation of cellular memory  [25,52–55]), and showed that cellu lar learning can be perceived 
as Hebbian learning [48] of signa lling networks, where learning  is accompanied by 
strengthening of those protein-pr otein, protein-microRNA and ch romatin interactions, which 
participate in the learning pro cess [10]. In this review we sum marize our current knowledge 
on the other side of the coin: w hen signalling networks ‘refuse ’ to learn more, and become 
desensitised by prol onged presence of the provoking signal, by stress or aging. 
 
Cellular learning proceeds using s everal molecular mechanisms, such as conformational 
memory of intrinsically disorder ed proteins (IDPs ), prions and mnemons [10–16], protein 
translocation [18–21], as well as  miRNAs and lncRNAs [6,7,22–24 ]. System level responses 
of cellular learning include  chromatin memory [3,5,8,9,25–32], signalling protein kinase 
cascades [33–38], as well as networ k responses other than those  of signalling networks, such 
as metabolic reaction netwo rks and metabolons [40–47]. 
 
Besides Hebbian learning [10] by t he molecular mechanisms liste d in the previous paragraph, 
non-neural cells also display a nti-Hebbian learning, where conn ection strengths decrease 
between the signalling netwo rk components [23,31,51,52]. Cells are also able to ‘forget’ 
using TET DNA demethylases, lncRNAs or molecular chaperones [58 –60] besides 
developing a cellular memory. 
 
A cellular habituation-type of r esponse is the development of d esensitisation. This often 
involves first decoupling of signalling network components from  each other followed by 
receptor internalization and dow nregulation [61–70]. This may b e displayed by cross- 
desensitisation, where prolonged e xposure for a pathway agonist  induces the desensitisation 
of other pathway(s) [72,73]. A specific condition of generally increased signal intensity 
and/or complexity is stress, whi ch desensitises a wide range of  signals [74–81]. Aging can be 
perceived as a result of cumula tive stress [82–86], which downr egulates a large number of 
signalling pathways [87–91]. 
 
Here we propose that cellular learning, desensitisation, stress  and aging may be placed as 
responses along the same axis of m ore and more intensive (more and more prolonged, or 
more and more often repeated) si gnals (Fig. 2). We pose the que stion, whether single cells 
may also display discriminati on between repeated and unexpected  signals, a common 
property of neuronal and artific ial neural networks (Fig. 3A) [ 93–95]. As a first step in 
answering this question, we pres ent fold-change detection enabl ing I1-FFLs as anti-Hebbian 
learning mechanisms that are pot entially general features of si gnalling networks given their 
occurrence in prominent signalling pathways like NF- κB (Fig. 3B) and TGF- β signalling [96, 
98-101]. 10  Finally, we summarize applicati ons of signalling network learni ng and desensitisation in 
clinical treatments discriminati ng between five scenarios (Fig.  4): 1.) when cellular Hebbian 
learning is mimicked b y chemically induced proximity between si gnalling network 
components [103,104]; 2.) when cel lular anti-Hebbian learning i s mimicked by chemically 
induced proximity of protein d egradation [104,105]; 3.) when de sensitisation of unwanted 
signalling (such as that in cance r) is the mechanism of drug ac tion [105]; 4.) when 
desensitisation of wanted si gnalling occurs, and should be avoi ded (in cancer, asthma, 
diabetes or heart failure [ 106, 110–114]); and finally, 5.) whe n sensitisation against a drug 
occurs by allergic reaction, wh ich also should be minimized (in  cancer, inflammatory 
diseases, diabetes or i nfections [107,109,110]). 
 
We hope that our summary will prompt further investigations of the phenomena, when cells 
learn (develop cellula r memory) by Hebbian l earning type proces ses, and when they ‘refuse’ 
to learn more, i.e. b ecome desensitised (display anti-Hebbian l earning, i.e. cellular 
‘forgetting’) by prolonged exposure to environmental signals, b y stress or by aging. It is an 
interesting question, how much de sensitisation remains specific  for the given pathway, and 
how much it is displayed as cross-desensitisation of other path ways, or as a general forgetting 
(desensitisation) of many (if not  all) pathways. While agonist- induced desensitisation is 
mostly the former, directed type  desensitisation against the sa me pathway (or selected 
different pathways), stress- and aging-induced desensitisation are usually more widespread 
phenomena involving a larger segmen t of the signa lling network.  We predict that network 
methodologies will greatly help the  discrimination between thes e scenarios.

Fig. 2 Repeated signals induce cellular learning; persistent signals l ead to cellular 
desensitisation; permanent signa ls (such as the accumulated sig nals and damage in aging) 
overload the signalling networ k and provoke cellular stress. No te that on the contrary to the 
few studies showing a change fro m cellular lear ning to desensit isation in the same system 
[69,92], comparative studies of a gonist-, stress- and aging-ind uced desensitisation are 
missing. Therefore, this figure is only hypothetical, illustrat ive and by no means quantitative. 18   
 
Fig. 3 Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learni ng layers in neuronal and signal ling networks. A) 
Schematic representation of the  combination of Hebbian- and ant i-Hebbian learning layers, 
which result in the discrimina tion between predictable and unex pected inputs. The 
cerebellum-like laminar structure of the figure is widespread i n various animal and human 
neuronal networks [95] and wa s also shown to w ork in computatio nal neural networks 
[93,94]. Note that self-inhibitor y connections (‘autapses’) are  not necessarily needed for the 
circuit. B) Proposed Hebbian and a nti-Hebbian learning layers i n the NF- κB signalling. 
Receptor proximally, the signalli ng of multiple receptors can l ead to the activation of the NF- 
κB pathway through TRAFs. Concurre ntly, some can lead to the act ivation of the adjacent 
AP-1 signalling pathway [98]. T his constitutes a horizontal act ivation in the proposed 
Hebbian learning layer in the upstream signalling. In the downs tream signalling, AP1 and the 
non-canonical NF- κB pathway modulate NF- κB target genes (e.g., inter leukin-8, interleukin- 
6). The canonical NF- κB (RelA-p52 heterodimer) has also  been shown [100] to upregulat e the 
formation of the transcripti onally inactive p50-p50/p52-p52 hom odimers that act as 
competitors to NF- κB for κB sites in the target genes’ promoters. These interactions, 
highlighted in red, constitute a Type-1 incoherent feed-forward  loop (I1-FFL, see inset) that 
can be understood as an anti-Hebbi an learning mechanism. This s ystem enables fold-change 
detection of the incoming signal in NF- κB nuclear levels, that is analogous to discrimination 
between predictable a nd unexpected inputs. This figure was crea ted with yEd Graph Editor. 19

induced proximity of protein deg radation. c.) Desensitisation ( drug-induced anti-Hebbian 
learning) of unwanted signalling (such as that in cancer). d.) Prevention of desensitisation of
