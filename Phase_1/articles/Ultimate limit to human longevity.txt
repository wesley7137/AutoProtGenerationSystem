Are there limits to human longevity? We suggest a new demographic model to describe 
human demographic trajectories. Specifically, the model mathematically defines the 
limits of longevity. Through the demographic analysis of trends for Sweden (between 
1751 and 2002), Switzerland (between 1876 and 2002) and Japan (between 1950 and 
1999), which are the longest-lived countries, we would like to demonstrate whether or 
not there is the ultimate limit to longevity. We analyse the trends of new demographic 
indicators, the characteristic life and the shape parameter, and calculate the 
mathematical limits of longevity. We find out the surprising phenomenon that the 
mathematical limits of longevity decrease as the longevity tendency increases in recent 
decades. These paradoxical trends will be explained by the complementarity of 
longevity, which is attributable to the nature of biological systems for longevity. 
According to the regression analysis, the ultimate limit for humans is estimated to be 
approximately 124 years, which may be considered to be the biological limit for 
humans.

1. Introduction 
A fundamental question in ageing research is whether humans possess ultimate 
limits to longevity (Wilmoth et al. 2000). Such a question has yet to be resolved, 
although more and more scientists are coming to believe that human longevity may be 
on the increase (Vaupel et al. 1998; Wilmoth et al. 2000; Long-lived bet 2001; Oeppen 
& Vaupel 2002). However, Hayflick (2000) pointed out, “If we are to increase human 
life expectancy beyond the fifteen-year limit that would result if today’s leading causes 
of death were resolved, more attention must be paid to basic research on ageing”. 
According to Vaupel et al. (2003), “Since 1840, record life expectancy has increased by 
2.5 years per decade, but will this march to longevity continue for many more decades?” 
If there are increases and/or limitations in the trends of human longevity at present, then 
how should we analyse it? The conventional demographic model and methodology in 
the field of demography and biology seem to be not fully successful to identify whether 
there are limits to human longevity (Wilmoth 1997). 
 
2. Material 
For analysis, we used the survival data for Sweden (between 1751 and 2002), 
Switzerland (between 1876 and 2002), and Japan (between 1950 and 1999), which are 
the longest-lived countries, from the period life tables (for all sexes, 1x1) taken from the 
Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org). The all period, which are available for 
each country in the Human Mortality Database, were chosen. The survival probability 
(S) is expressed as a fraction (lx/lo) of the number of survivors (lx) out of 100,000 
persons (lo) in the original life tables. 
 3 
3. Model 
In order to describe human demographic trajectories, a new demographic model 
has been found by Weon for the first time to our knowledge. We would like to call this 
new model the “Weon model” hereafter, as the Gompertz model was formulated by 
Benjamin Gompertz and thus it bears his name. The Weon model is derived from the 
Weibull model (Weibull 1951) with an assumption that the shape parameter is a 
function of age. In the Weibull model, the shape parameter is constant with age (Nelson 
1990). The age-dependent shape parameter enables us to model the demographic 
(survival and mortality) functions, which are expressed as follows, 
 
))/( exp( )()(tt tSba- =  
])()/ln()([ )/()()(
dttdtttt tt baba mb´ + ´ =  
 
where )(tS is the survival function, indicating the probability that an individual is still 
alive at age t and )(tm is the mortality function, indicating the probability density at 
age conditional on survival to that age, in which a denotes the characteristic life (a=t  
when %79.36)1 exp( )( »- =tS ) and )(tb  denotes the shape parameter as a function of 
age. The original idea was obtained as follows: typical human survival curves show i) a 
rapid decrease in survival in the first few years of life and then ii) a relatively steady 
decrease and then an abrupt decrease near death. Interestingly, the former behaviour 
resembles the Weibull survival function with 1<b  and the latter behaviour seems to 4 
follow the case of 1>>b . With this in mind, it could be assumed that shape parameter 
is a function of age. 
The Weon model is completely different with the Weibull model in the age 
dependence of the shape parameter. We could evaluate the age dependence of the shape 
parameter to determine an adequate mathematical expression of the shape parameter, 
after determination of the characteristic life graphically in the survival curve. 
Conveniently, the value of the characteristic life is always found at the duration for the 
survival to be ‘ )1 exp(-’; this is known as the characteristic life. This feature gives the 
advantage of looking for the value of a simply by graphical analysis of the survival 
curve. In turn, with the observed value of a, we can plot the shape parameter as a 
function of age by the mathematical equivalence of ‘ )/ln(/))(ln ln( )( a b t tS t - = ’. If 
)(tb  is not constant with age, this obviously implies that ‘ )(tb  is a function of age’. In 
empirical practice, we could successfully use a polynomial expression for modelling the 
shape parameter as a function of age as follows: ... )(2
2 1 0 + + + = t t t b b b b , where the 
associated coefficients could be determined by a regression analysis in the plot of shape 
parameter curve. And thus, the derivative is obtained as follows: 
... 2 /)(2 1 + + = t dttd b b b , which indicates again that the shape parameter for humans is 
a function of age. If )(tb  (except for the mathematical singularity or trace of a) can be 
expressed by an adequate mathematical function, the survival and mortality functions 
can be calculated by the mathematically expressed )(tb . 
As we know, no mathematical model has been suggested that can perfectly 
approximate the development of the mortality rate over the total life span (Kowald 
1999). In practice for the Weon model, a linear expression for )(tb  is roughly 5 
appropriate for ages before a and a quadratic expression is appropriate for ages after a. 
With these mathematical expressions of the shape parameter, we could solve the 
conventional problems to describe the demographic trajectories. The fundamental 
demographic model is the Gompertz model (Gompertz 1825), in which the human 
mortality rate increases roughly exponentially with increasing age at senescence. 
However, the mortality rate does not increase according to the Gompertz model at the 
highest ages (Vaupel 1997; Thatcher et al. 1998; Robine & Vaupel 2001; 2002; Yi & 
Vaupel 2003), and this deviation from the Gompertz model is a great puzzle to 
demographers, biologists and gerontologists (Vaupel 1997). Furthermore, it is still not 
certain whether the mortality trajectories level or decrease at the highest ages (Vaupel 
1997; Vaupel et al. 1998; Thatcher 1999; Lynch & Brown 2001; Robine & Vaupel 
2001; 2002; Helfand & Inouye 2002). By the way, the Weon model through the 
quadratic expression for )(tb  predicts that the mortality rate inevitably decreases after a 
plateau and ultimately approach zero. Furthermore, through the approximate 
relationship of ‘ )( )(ln t tb m µ ’ after adulthood (~30-80) by the linear expression for 
)(tb , the Weon model approximates the Gompertz model when ‘ ttµ)(b ’. Particularly, 
the mortality rate would deviate from the Gompertz model when )(tb  has a non-linear 
behaviour. It is therefore possible that )(tb  is a measure of the deviation from the 
Gompertz model at the highest ages. The Weon model can therefore generalize the 
Gompertz model as well as the Weibull model: That is, the Gompertz model is a special 
case of a linear expression for )(tb  and the Weibull model is a special case of a 
constant shape parameter. 
According to the above mortality function, the Weon model suggests a simple 
mathematical definition of limits of longevity as follows: In principle, the mortality 6 
function should be mathematically positive ( 0)(³tm ). Therefore, the mathematical 
criterion for limits of longevity, which is able to be determined by the mortality 
trajectories in nature, can be given by, 
 
)/ln()( )(
ab b
ttt
dttd-³  
 
In fact, it is possible that the survival function calculated through modeling the shape 
parameter for the highest ages is not zero, although it has extremely low values at the 
highest ages, but that the mortality function for the highest ages can reach zero at the 
mathematical limit of longevity. In this case, the decrease rate of the survival function 
( dttdS/)(- ; this term means the probability density function, and the minus indicates 
the decrease) should be zero at the mathematical limit of longevity. Therefore, the 
mathematical limit of longevity can be simply defined as “ 0 /)( = - dttdS  or 0)(=tm ”. 
It should be noted that the survival and mortality functions are linked to the 
mathematical relationship of “ )(/1 /)( )( tS dttdS t ´ -= m ”. In practice, we can identify 
the mathematical limit of longevity at the moment that the survival trajectory levels off, 
or the mortality trajectory becomes zero. 
 
4. Results 
Evidently, we could see the age dependence of the shape parameter for humans, 
through the trajectories of shape parameter plotted for Sweden, Switzerland and Japan 
in Fig. 1 (a)~(c). On the other hand, )(tb  mathematically approaches infinity as the age 
t approaches the value of a or the denominator ‘ )/ln(at ’ approaches zero. This 7 
feature leaves the ‘trace of a’ in the plot of )(tb , thus we could observe variations of 
)(tb  and a at once, as shown in Fig. 1 (a)~(c). 
We carried out the regression analysis for ages after a for Sweden (between 
1751 and 2002) in Table S1, for Switzerland (between 1876 and 2002) in Table S2 and 
for Japan (between 1950 and 1999) in Table S3 (in Supplementary Table), using the 
quadratic expression for )(tb . Specifically, the quadratic coefficient is important 
because it determines the mathematical limit of longevity in consequence of the 
quadratic expression of )(tb  for the highest ages. With this in mind, we would like to 
demonstrate the historical trends of the characteristic life and quadratic coefficient over 
time. First, the characteristic life has increased constantly for more than a century in Fig. 
2 (a), which is consistent with other literature, although the rates of increase are slightly 
different by country (Vaupel et al. 1998; Wilmoth et al. 2000; Oeppen & Vaupel 2002; 
Vaupel et al. 2003). The characteristic life has increased by approximately 1.48 years 
per decade for Sweden (between 1751 and 2002), 2.08 years per decade for Switzerland 
(between 1876 and 2002) and 2.77 years for Japan (between 1950 and 1999), 
respectively. Second, it could be seen in Fig. 2 (b) that the quadratic coefficient of the 
shape parameter, which indicates the decrease (or bending down) of the shape 
parameter at the highest ages, has similarly increased over time for the countries. 
Particularly, significant increases have taken place since 1970s.  
Yet to our surprise, it is likely to be obvious that the mathematical limit of 
longevity tends to decrease as the quadratic coefficient increases in Fig. 3. In other 
words, the trend of the mathematical limit runs in clear contradiction to the trend of the 
characteristic life. Why seems to be there such a contradiction? To answer this question, 
we need to reconsider what the origin of the age-dependent shape parameter is. In 8 
principle for the highest value of the survival trajectory or for longevity at all times, the 
shape parameter should be variable according to the characteristic life: “for longevity, 
)(tb  tends to increase at a<t  but it tends to decrease at a>t .” This is attributable to 
the nature of biological systems to strive to survive healthier and longer robustly against 
intrinsic defects and circumstances (Kirkwood & Austad 2000; Ball 2002). This 
tendency seems to be obvious in the Fig. 1 (a)~(c). Empirically, we already know that 
the quadratic coefficient indicates the decrease (or bending down) of )(tb  at a>t . The 
characteristic life tends to increase over time as well as the quadratic coefficient in Fig. 
2 (a) and (b). By contraries, the mathematical limit of longevity tends to decrease with 
the quadratic coefficient in Fig. 3. Therefore, we come to the conclusion that the 
mathematical limit of longevity decreases as the longevity tendency (the characteristic 
life) increases. We call this phenomenon the “complementarity of longevity”. That is, 
the longevity tendency bends down the shape parameter after the characteristic life, 
which simultaneously is the reason of decreasing the mathematical limit of longevity. 
The complementarity caused by the longevity tendency is attributable to the nature of 
biological systems to strive to survive healthier and longer robustly against intrinsic 
defects and circumstances. It is the age dependence of the shape parameter that is likely 
to be governed by the complementarity of longevity. 
 
5. Discussion 
Where is the ultimate limit to human longevity? Finally, we are able to see that 
the trend line (if denoted as “w”) empirically fitted by an exponential model of the 
mathematical limits with the quadratic coefficient seems to be 
“ ) 0004.0/ exp( 1.183 0.1242b w ´ + » ” ( 9395.02=r ) in Fig. 3. Note that 2b is negative. 9 
In this case, the ultimate value of the mathematical limits as ‘ -¥®2b ’, assuming that 
the longevity tendency increases extremely, leading to that the bending down of the 
shape parameter is maximized, can be predicted to be approximately 124 years totally 
for Sweden, Switzerland and Japan. Interestingly, this value is approximate to the world 
record for human longevity of Jeanne Calment, who lived to the ripe old age of 122 
years and 164 days (122.45 years) (Vallin & Meslé 2001).  
Considering the scattering of the data points, the results suggest that the human 
longevity should be ultimately limited around 120 years, which may be associated with 
the biological limits (Hayflick 1996; 1998; 2000; Carnes et al. 2003) and the 
demographic evidence in history (Shapin & Martyn 2000). The human life span has 
remained unchanged for the past 100,000 years at about 125 years (Hayflick 1996; 
1998; 2000). Although the life expectancy is likely to continuously increase, the 
ultimate limit to longevity is not likely to be broken. It is probably impossible to surpass 
the barrier without intrinsic (or biological) changes of human body.  
Moreover, the significant increase of longevity since 1970s (Fig. 2 (b)) is likely 
to be associated with the improvement of medical care, for example, an introduction of 
heart transplant. Today, in developed countries more than 75% of all deaths now occur 
in those over the age of 75 (Hayflick 2000). Of the total increase of longevity, 72.5% is 
attributable to a decline in mortality above age 70 (Wilmoth et al. 2000). Maybe further 
improvement of medical care will be effective to continuously increase the longevity 
(life expectancy, or characteristic life) in a population, although it is difficult to surpass 
the ultimate limit around 120 years. If so, we may expect that the older persons will 
continue to accumulate between 80 and 120 years. Then, we will need a policy and 10 
expenditures to take care of the older persons to be piled up in the forthcoming future 
(Friedland 1998; Lubitz et al. 2003).

1. Weon model: Empirical descriptive model for humans 
The Weon model is a modified Weibull model with an age-dependent shape parameter 
as follows. The age dependence of shape parameter is attributable to dynamical aspects 
of biological system (humans). 
 
1) Survival function: ))/( exp( )()(tt tSba- =  
2) Shape parameter: )/ln(/))(ln ln( )( a b t tS t - = , which empirically can be expressed 
by ‘ ... )(2
2 1 0 + + + = t t t b b b b ’ as a function of age. 
3) Mortality function: ])()/ln()([ )/()()(
dttdtttt tt baba mb´ + ´ =  
4) Density function: )()( )( t tStf m´ =  
 
 
2. Statistical relationships 
For statistical definitions, let )(tf be the probability density function (pdf) describing 
the distribution of life spans in a population. The cumulative density function (cdf), 
)(tF , gives the probability that an individual dies before surpassing age t (especially 
age t is a continuous random variable). The survival function, )(tS , gives the 
complementary probability ( )( 1)( tF tS -= ) that an individual is still alive at age t. The 
mortality function, )(tm, is defined as the ratio of the density and survival functions 
( )(/)( )( tStf t= m ). Thus, the mortality function gives the probability density at age t 
conditional on survival to that age. )(tS, )(tb , )(tm  and )(tf are variables as a 
function of age, and a, 0b, 1b and 2b are constants.

3. Singular points 
 
1) Characteristic life (a) 
Conveniently, the value of the characteristic life is always found at the duration for the 
survival to be ‘ )1 exp( )( - =tS ’; this is known as the characteristic life (figure A1 (a)). 
This feature gives the advantage of looking for the value of a simply by graphical 
analysis of the survival curve. The value of )(tb  mathematically approaches infinity as 
the age t approaches the value of a or the denominator ‘ )/ln(at ’ approaches zero. 
This feature leaves the ‘trace of a’ in the plot of )(tb , thus we can observe variations 
of )(tb  and a at once (figure A1 (b)). Empirically there seems to exist the maximum 
value (or the peak) of )(tf approximately at a (figure A1 (c)).

2) Vertex of shape parameter (n) 
It indicates a maximum value of shape parameter after characteristic life (figure A1 (b)):

3) Plateau of mortality (r) 
It indicates a maximum value of mortality function after characteristic life (figure A1 
(d)): 0)(=dttdm at r=t . 
 
4) Mathematical limit of longevity or shortly ‘maximum longevity’ (w) 
Perhaps the most common notion of a limit in the study of human longevity is the 
limited-life-span hypothesis, which states that there exists some age (w) beyond which 
there can be no survivors. This hypothesis can be expressed by any one of the following 
three formulas: “ 0)(=tf , 0)(=tS  or ¥=
®)( lim t
tm
w (w³t ).”  
However, according to the Weon model, the survival function may be not zero, 
although it has extremely low values at the highest ages, while the mortality function 
can be zero at the maximum longevity (figure A1 (d)). The Weon model suggests that 
the maximum longevity can be defined as follows: “at w=t , 0)(=tf  and 0)(=tm , 
instead of 0)(=tS .” Fundamentally, the decrease rate of the survival function with age 
( dttdS/)(- ; this term means the density function (pdf), )(tf, and the minus indicates 
the decrease) should be zero at the maximum longevity. Therefore, the maximum 
longevity can be simply defined as “ 0 /)( = - dttdS  or 0)(=tm ”. In practice, we can 
identify the maximum longevity at the moment that the survival trajectory levels off, or 
the mortality trajectory becomes zero.

4. Indicators of longevity 
1) Characteristic life (a) and vertex of shape parameter (n) are observable indicators 
of longevity in the trends of plot of shape parameter; there is empirically an inverse-
proportional relationship between a and n (figure A2).  
 
2) Maximum longevity is an estimated indicator of longevity; there is empirically a 
proportional relationship between n and w (figure A3). 
 
 
5. Complementarity of longevity 
1) Phenomenon: “As a increases (with quadratic coefficient of shape parameter), n 
(and w) decreases (with quadratic coefficient of shape parameter).”  
 
2) Logic: “For the highest )(tS  (for longevity), )(tb  increases at a<t  and )(tb  
decreases at a>t .” In consequence of longevity, since 2b indicates the decrease of 
)(tb  at a>t , the quantity of 2b increases with longevity (or a). This simultaneously 
induces the decrease of n (and w). There are obviously complementary aspects 
between a and n (and w). 
 
 
6. Ultimate limit 
1) Possible limit: 0®n  with longevity; 01®b  or ¥®2b . There is no clue that 1b 
approaches zero; instead, it is observed that 2b (quadratic coefficient of shape 
parameter) increases as increasing a. 
 
2) Estimation: There seems to exist an ultimate limit of w as 2b increases. If we 
assume that w has an exponential relationship with 2b, the result of regression analysis 
is given as follows: ) 0004.0/ exp( 1.183 0.1242b w ´ + » ( 9395.02=r ). Therefore, the 
ultimate value can be estimated to be ~124 years for Sweden, Switzerland and Japan 
(figure A4). 
 
 
7. Implication 
“Human longevity is ultimately limited at an intrinsic (or biological) limit.”
