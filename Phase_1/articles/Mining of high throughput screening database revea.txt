Title: Mining of high throughput screening database reveals AP-1 and autophagy
  pathways as potential targets for COVID-19 therapeutics
Abstract:   The recent global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by
the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents an urgent need for new therapeutic
candidates. Many efforts have been devoted to screening existing drug libraries
with the hope to repurpose approved drugs as potential treatments for COVID-19.
However, the antiviral mechanisms of action for the drugs found active in these
phenotypic screens are largely unknown. To deconvolute the viral targets for
more effective anti-COVID-19 drug development, we mined our in-house database
of approved drug screens against 994 assays and compared their activity
profiles with the drug activity profile in a cytopathic effect (CPE) assay of
SARS-CoV-2. We found that the autophagy and AP-1 signaling pathway activity
profiles are significantly correlated with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity
profile. In addition, a class of neurology/psychiatry drugs was found
significantly enriched with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Taken together, these
results have provided new insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential
targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.

  Abstract  
The recent global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019  (COVID -19) caused b y the new coronavirus 
SARS -CoV-2 presents an urgent need for new therapeutic candidates.  Many efforts have been devoted 
to screening existing drug libraries with the hope to repurpose approved  drugs as potential treatments 
for COVID -19. However, the antiv iral mechanisms of action for the drugs found active in these 
phenotypic screens are largely unknown. To deconvolute the viral targets for more effective anti -COVID -
19 drug development, we mined our in -house database of  approved drug sc reens  against 994 assays  
and compared their activity profiles with the drug activity profile  in a cytopathic effect (CPE) assay of 
SARS -CoV-2. We found that the  autophagy and AP -1 signaling  pathway  activity profile s are significantly 
correlated with the an ti-SARS -CoV-2 activity profile . In addition, a class of neurology/psychiatry drugs 
was found significantly enriched with anti -SARS -CoV-2 activity.  Taken together , the se results have 
provided  new insight s into SARS -CoV-2 infection and potential  targets for COVID -19 therapeutic s. 
  Introduction  
In late fall 2019, a new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) emerged from Wuhan, China. It is caused 
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2). SARS -CoV-2 appears to be high ly 
contagious , and a lack of immunity in the human population  has resulted in  rapid  spread across the 
globe. As of June 28rd, 2020, it has infected over 10 million people, killed over 500,000 people, and 
caused abrupt disruption of  social and economic activity across the world ( https://covid19.who.int/ ).  
 
Currently, there is no effective treatment for COVID -19. Drug development typically takes 12 -16 years 
and costs US$1 -2 billion to bring a new drug to market1. Preventative approaches such as vaccine s and 
antibod ies could also take years to develop . Given that treatments for patients infected with SARS -CoV-
2 are needed immediately, r epurposing existing drugs  and clinical investigation al drugs  to treat COVID -
19 is an attractive  strategy. This approach takes advantage of known human pharmacokineti c and safety 
profile s of drugs, which allow rapid initiation of  human clinical trials  or direct use for treatments . 
Remdesivir is a good example of such effort to treat COVID -19. Remdesivir was originally developed for 
RNA viruses  and was the n tested in a clinical trial against Ebola virus infection  during the  2016  outbr eak 
2,3. After remdesivi r was shown to be active against SARS -CoV-2 in vitro4, clinical trials have been rapidly 
conducted . In a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlle d trial carried out by the National Institutes 
of Health (NIH), remdesivir was demonstrated effective in reducing the recovery time from 15 days to 11 
days in hospitalized COVID -19 patients5. On May 1st, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational antiviral drug remdesivir for the 
treatment of hospitalized COVID -19 pa tients. While many clinical trials are still ongoing and are showing 
promisin g results ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID -19), some repurposing efforts have 
had disappoint ing or controversial  outcomes , for example, those for lopinavir -ritonavir6, 
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) , and  chloroquine (CQ)7,8. 
 
Other than an intuitive  repurposing approach based on a known mechanism (such as the recent positive 
reports of dexametha sone for modulating inflammatory response in COVID19)9, an unbiased and 
systematic screening of approved drug or clinical in vestigation al drugs might discover additional 
therapeutic options . Multiple sites  10-14, including our center (The National Center for Advancing 
Translational Sciences, NCATS), are screening approved drug  and mechanistically annotated  librar ies to 
identify new therapeutics. To rapidly share the screening results and accelerate the drug repurposing 
process, NCATS has posted all screening data on an online database (Open Science Data Portal of COVID -19) ( https://opend ata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/index.html ) that is  freely available to the public15. In most  
antiviral drug repurposing effor ts, the most scalable assay used for screening  in biological safety level -3 
laboratories  is a phenotypic assay, measuring the cytopathic effect (CPE) of SARS -CoV-2 virus on Vero E6 
cells infected for 72 hours. If compounds have antiviral activity, Vero E6 cells are rescued from the CPE . 
While there are many drugs with known targets /mechanism s of action  for their approved indications , 
the targets or  mechanism s of their antiviral activity  are largely unknown , be it against a host of viral 
target 10-14. It is thus crucial to better understand their antiviral mechanism s to facilitate further drug 
development.  
 
The NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) 16 is a library of ~3,000 drugs approved for marketing in the 
US (FDA), Europe (EMA), Canada, Australia, and/or Japan (PMDA). The library was specifically created to 
enable drug repurposing and has been screened at NCATS in nearly 1 ,000 assays in concentration -
response ( quantitative high throughput screening, qHTS), enco mpassing a wide range of disease targets 
and pathways  with main disease areas covered including rare a nd neglected diseases, infectious 
diseases and cancer . Here, we leveraged this unique dataset to compare  activity across SARS -CoV-2 CPE 
screening  data (bo th from NCATS and published elsewhere)  6,14,17 -21 with historical in house NPC qHTS 
data. Correlations were performed to identify  assays with patterns of activity  similar to that of the SARS -
CoV-2 CPE assay . 
 
Resul ts 
Mining qHTS data reveals interesting anti -SARS -CoV-2 targets : Autophagy and AP -1 signaling  
Screening compounds using phenotypic assays , such as the CPE assay, has identified compounds t hat 
inhibit ed cell death caused by the SARS -CoV-2 infection.  Compari ng the NPC compound activity profile 
in each of the ~1000 screens performed previously on various target s with the activity profile  against 
SARS -CoV-2 may help identify targets of the compounds with anti -SARS -CoV-2 activity, and provide 
important clues to the underlying targets and mechanisms of the pathogenesis of SARS -CoV-2. Assays 
with activity profiles which resemble that of SARS -CoV-2 could serve as  targets for the development of 
new COVID -19 therapies. Toward this goal, we collected compounds reported  as active from recent anti -
COVID -19 repurposing screens  using the SARS -CoV-2 CPE assay14,17,18 and drugs proposed by the 
scientific community as potential CO VID-19 therapies.10,19 -21 Activities of these compounds were used as 
a “probe signature” to compare with the activity profiles of all other assays ( Figure 1 (a)). Compound activity was represented by “curve rank”,22,23 a numeric measure between -9 and 9 based on potency, 
efficacy, and the quality of th e concentration response curve, such that a large positive number 
indicates a strong activator, a large negative number indicates a strong inhibitor, and 0 means inactive. 
Activity p rofile similarity was measured by the Pearson Correlation Coefficient ( r) with a p -value 
calculated for the significance of correlation ( Figure 2 ). 
The activity profiles  from an autophagy  assay  (r = 0.47, p<1 ×10-20)24 and an AP -1 signaling pathway assay 
(r = 0.37, p<1 ×10-20)25 exhibited the most significant correlations with that of the  SARS -CoV-2 screen  
(Figure 1(b)) . Interestingly, two other antiviral assays, a n Ebola virus -like particle entry assay (EBOV)  (r = 
0.39, p<1 ×10-20)26 and a MERS pseudo  particle entry assay ( r = 0.28, p<1 ×10-20),27 were also among the 
most significant ly correlat ed assays  with activity profiles that highly resemble that of the SARS -CoV-2 
CPE assay  (Figure 1(b)) . As MERS belongs to the same family of  beta -coronaviruses as SARS -CoV-2, this 
finding can serve as a validation of our approach.28-30 Moreover, r emdesivir , an antiviral drug active 
against  Ebola was recently found effective against SARS -CoV-2 in vitro  assays and approved for treating 
hospitalized COVID -19 patients.5,31 This is consis tent with our finding that a significant number (118) of 
drugs including remdesivir that showed anti -Ebola activity also showed activity in the SARS -CoV-2 CPE 
assay, suggesting some shared drug targets  (either viral target or cellular targets)  between EBOV  and 
SARS -CoV-2autophagy and AP -1 assays were combined, i.e., a compound was counted as active if it was 
active in either one of these assays and inactive otherwise, the sensitivity in picking up SARS -CoV-2 
actives increase d to 0.85 with an improved BA of 0.81. This suggests that the targets in these two assays 
are different and either autophagy or AP -1 could only account for one mechanism in targeting SARS -
CoV-2, thus combining the two pathways might increase the likelihood  of identifying drugs that could 
target SARS -CoV-2 through different mechanisms.  
A list of the most potent compounds (<20 µM) in the AP -1 assay and their corresponding activities in the 
autophagy and SARS -CoV-2 CPE assays are provided in Table 2 . These dru gs could be considered for 
further anti -COVID -19 development.  Concentration -response curves of exemplar  compounds that were 
active in all three assays are shown in Figure 3 . 
Enrichment of neuroactive drugs in anti -SARS -CoV-2 and AP -1 active compounds  
Anoth er interesting phenomenon w e observed is that a large number of compounds active in the SARS -
CoV-2 CPE assay are psychoactive drugs.  We next investigated the statistical significance of this finding. 
There were 359 drugs annotated as neurology/psychiatry drugs tested in the SARS -CoV-2 CPE assay. We found that 74 of them are active (21%)  (Supplementary Table 1 ), whereas only 8% of the drugs not in 
this category were active in the SARS -CoV-2 CPE assay, corresponding to a 2. 6-fold enrichment of actives 
in the  neuroactive drugs. This en richment is statistically significant (Fisher’s exact test: p= 2.41 ×10-11). To 
check whether this phenomenon only occurs in this class of drugs, we also examined five other common 
drugs classes, including infectious disease, card iology, endocrinology, gastroenterology , and oncology. 
We found that none of these classes were  significantly enriched with the anti -SARS -CoV-2 active 
compounds  (Figure 4). The results suggest  possible connections between  the psychoactive drugs  and 
the tar gets/pat hways related to  SARS -CoV-2 infection or replication in host cells.   
 
Discussion  
To deconvolute the viral targets for more effective anti -COVID -19 drug development , we compared the 
compound activity profile s from our historic al qHTS data with rece nt SARS -CoV-2 CPE assay data. We 
found that activities  against autophagy and AP -1 significantly correlated with anti -SARS -CoV-2 activity. 
We also found strong  correlation s between  SARS -CoV-2 and other antiviral assays such as MERS -CoV 
pseudo  particle entry . It is intuitive given that both are zoonotic beta -coronaviruses with similar 
genomes and a common cellular entry mechanism. Since the identification of SARS -CoV-2, multiple 
agents shown to be active against MERS -CoV and SARS -CoV over the past 15 years ha ve be en tested and 
demonstrated to retain activity against SARS -CoV-2. The analysis here of independent assays performed 
years apart reinforces this observation.  
Autophagy and endocytosis are interconnected cellular pathways for the degradation and recycli ng of  
intracellular and extracellular components, respectively. The two pathways inter act and interdepend on 
each other,  shar ing some molecular machinery32. The autophagy /endocytosis pathway ha s been 
implicated in the ent ry of  coronavirus into host cells, including SARS -CoV, MERS -CoV and SARS -CoV-
212,33. In our recent study, a small number of autophagy modulators were tested to clarify whether the 
activity of CQ/HCQ was related to its autophagy modulatory properties , and a number of active  
compounds were confirmed in the CPE assay12. Here, our unbiased comparison of the SARS -CoV-2 CPE 
assay with appr oximately 1,000 NCATS qHTS assays targeting various drugs targets and diseases found a 
significant correlat ion with an autophagy assay screened against the NPC library  several years earlier, 
further validat ing our data mining approach. Targeting th e autoph agy pathway has been tested  in 
clinical trials  for curbing COVID -19. For example, CQ and HCQ  are antimalaria drugs and known 
autophagy inhibitors. HCQ/CQ h ave shown promising anti -SARS -CoV-2 activity in vitro12,34,35; however, their therapeutic effect in COVID -19 patients are still controversial7,8. Our analysis here reinforc es that 
more  selective  and potent  modulator s of autophagy pathways should be further evaluated in pre -clinical 
models for antiviral activity.  Another factor that  need s to be taken into consideration  is that the 
coronavirus can take two distinct pathways fo r cell entry, either endosomal or non -endosomal . Blocking 
autophagy , which is the endocytosis pathway , might not be  sufficient to block the viral entry,  and 
combination approaches , e.g., combination treatmen ts with autophagy inhibitor s and TMPRSS2 
inhibito rs36, warrant consideration . 
Activator protein 1 ( AP-1) is a dimeric transcription factor composed of proteins belonging to the Jun , 
Fos, ATF and JDP families  and regulates a range of cellular process es. The AP-1 transcription factor 
family could be activated by different stimuli, such as cytokines, stress,  bacterial and viral infections37. 
The AP-1 signaling pathway has been shown to be activated by the SARS -CoV viral parti cle38, the spike 
protein39, the nucleocapsid protein40 and the accessory protein 3b41. In a recent study,  J un, one of the 
AP-1 protein s, has been identified as one of the top hub host proteins, which is directly targeted by CoV 
proteins or indirectly involved in the CoV infection 42. The activation of AP -1 signaling might serve as an 
immun e response for the host to fight viral infection s. One hypothesis that can be drawn from this 
observation is that the AP-1 pathway may  be hijacked by the coronavirus and  mediate the process  of the 
CPE, and disruption of the AP -1 pathway could offset this  process . While this hypothesis has not been 
directly tested, the correlation we found between AP -1 and SARS -CoV-2 points to this as a druggable 
host pathway for SARS -CoV-2 and future emergent coronaviruses .  
Psych oactive  drugs  have been reported  to be  activ e against  SARS -CoV-210,14,17,18. Here we found that the 
neurology/psychiatry class of drugs , in contrast to  other classes of drugs, w as significantly enriched in 
anti-SARS -CoV-2 activity. Most of the active compoun ds in the neurology/psychiatry class of drugs are 
psychoactive drugs, which target  G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly monoamine 
receptor s (86% of the psychoactive drugs that showed anti -SARS -CoV-2 activity belong to this category ) 
(Supplemen tary Table  1). We hypothesize that those compounds might bind to membrane receptors  
and activate intracellular pathway s to fight coronavirus es. It is interesting that  among the compounds 
that were active in both the AP -1 and SARS -CoV-2 CPE assays, we found  a more pr onounced enrichment 
of neurology/psychiatry drugs (3.76 -fold; p = 3.89 ×10-11), suggesting that these drugs may also act 
through the AP -1 pathway to inhibit SARS -CoV-2. Another hypothesis is that SARS -CoV-2 might infect 
cells through other unknown  membrane proteins in addition to  angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 ) 
and those compounds might interfere with the viral binding to its receptors. GPCRs have been shown to be hijacked by viruses as co -receptors for entry into host cells43-45. A French study  reported that lower 
incidences of the symptomatic forms of COVID -19 were found among psychiatric patients (~4%) than 
clinical staff (~14%)46. An anti-psychiatric drug,  chlorpromazine  (Figure 3 ), has been repurposed for 
COVID -19 treatment, and is currently in phase III clinical trial 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04366739 ). In another phase II clin ical trial , fluvoxamine , a 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) , was found  to prevent more serious complications of 
COVID -19 infection  (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04342663 ). Pre-clinical data and clinical 
observation s of those psychoactive drugs are prom ising ; however, further clinical evidence and data are 
required  to confirm  the anti -SARS -CoV-2 effect  of those psychoactive drugs .   
 
In summary, we discovered that the auto phagy and AP -1 signaling pathways might be potential targets 
for COVID -19 therapeut ics through systematic mining of a large qHTS database. In addition, the class of 
neurology/psychiatry drugs was found significantly enriched with anti -SARS -CoV-2 active com pounds, 
indicating that this class of drugs also has the potential to be repurposed  as treatments for COVID -19 
that warrant  further investigation .  
 
Materials  and Methods  
SARS -CoV-2 cytopathic effect (CPE) assay  Vero -E6 cells previo usly selected for high A CE2 
expression 47 (grown in EMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) were cultured in T175 
flasks and passag ed at 95% confluency. Cells were washed once with PBS and dissociated from 
the flask using TrypLE . Cells were counted prior to seeding.  A CPE assay previously used to 
measure antiviral effects against SARS -CoV 48 was adapted for performance in 384 well plates 
to measure CPE of SARS CoV -2 with the following modifica tions. Cells , harvested and 
suspended at 160,000 cells/ml in MEM/1% PSG/1% HEPES supplemented 2% HI FBS , were 
batch inoculated with SARS CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) at M.O.I. of approximately 0.002 which 
resulted in approximately 5% cell viability 72 h post infec tion. Compound so lutions in DMSO 
were acoustically dispensed into assay ready plates (ARPs) at 3 point 1:5 titrations. ARPs were 
stored at -20°C and shipped to BSL3 facility (Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL) for 
CPE assay.  ARPs were brought to room temperature and 5µl of assay media was dispensed to all wells. The plates were transported into the BSL -3 facility were a 25 μL aliquot of virus 
inoculated cells (4000 Vero E6 cells/well) was added to each well in columns 3 -24. The wells in 
columns 23 -24 contained vi rus infected cells only (no compound treatment). A 25 μL aliquot of 
uninfected cells was added to columns 1 -2 of each plate for the cell only (no virus) controls. 
After incubating plates at 37°C with 5% CO 2 and 90% humidity for 72 h, 30 μL of Cell Titer -Glo 
(Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well. Following incubation at room temperature for 
10 minutes the plates were sealed with a clear cover , surface decontaminated , and 
luminescence was read using a Perkin Elmer Envision (Waltham, MA ) plate read er to measure 
cell viability.  
AP-1-bla ME -180 Assay  CellSensor® AP -1-bla ME -180 cell line and the culture medium 
components were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). These cells contain 
a beta -lactamase reporter gene under the control of AP -1 response element that has been 
stably integrated  into ME -180 cells. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 
10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 mM non -essential amino acids (NEAA), 1 mM 
sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml of 
blastcid in at 37°C under a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO2. AP -1-bla ME -180 cells were 
used to screen the NPC compound collection . The positive control s, human epidermal growth 
factor (EGF) for AP -1-bla and tetraoctyl ammonium bromide for cytotoxicity assays, were 
purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).  
CellSensor® AP -1-bla ME -180 cells were suspended in 6 μL of assay medium  (Opti-MEM with 
0.5% dialyzed FBS, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml 
streptomycin), and were dispensed at 2,500 cells per well in 1,536 -well tissue culture treated 
black/clear bottom plates (Greiner Bio -One North America , NC) using a Multidrop Combi 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). After incubation at 37°C for an overnight to facilitate cell adhesion, 
23 nL of compounds and positive controls were transferred into the assay plates by a Pintool 
station (Wako Automation, San Dieg o, CA). The assay plates were incubated for 5 hr at 37°C. 
One μl of LiveBLAzer™ FRET B/G (CCF4 -AM) substrate mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added 
using an FRD and incubated at room temperature for 2 hr. The fluorescence signal was 
measured using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) at excitation 405 nm,  and dual emissions at 460 and 530 nm. Data were expressed as relative fluorescence units 
(ratio of 460nm/530nm emissions). The cytotoxicity of each compound was tested in parallel in 
the same well by adding 4 µl/well of CellTiter -Glo reagent (Promega, Mad ison, WI) after beta -
lactamase read into the assay plates using an FRD. After 30 min incubation at room 
temperature, the luminescence signal was measured using a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin 
Elmer). Cytotoxicity data were expressed as relative luminescence  units.  Table 1. Activity concordance between the SARS -CoV-2 CPE assay and top correlated assays

large negative number indicates a strong inhibitor (blue), and 0 means inactive (light gray). Dark gray 
indicates missing data. (a) All assays. (b) Assays most co rrelated with SARS -CoV-2. 
 
 
 
Figure 2 . Activity profile correlations between assays. In the heat map, each row/column is a different 
assay readout. The heat m ap is colored by the correlation coefficient ( r), such that darker shades of red 
indicate stronge r positive correlations and darker shades of blue indicate stronger negative correlations. 
Gray means no correlation found.
