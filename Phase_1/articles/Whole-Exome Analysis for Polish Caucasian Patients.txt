Title: Whole-Exome Analysis for Polish Caucasian Patients with Retinal Dystrophies and the Creation of a Reference Genomic Database for the Polish Population.
Abstract: We present the results of the first study of a large cohort of patients with inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) performed for the Polish population using whole-exome sequencing (WES) in the years 2016-2019. Moreover, to facilitate such diagnostic analyses and enable future application of gene therapy and genome editing for IRD patients, a Polish genomic reference database (POLGENOM) was created based on whole-genome sequences of healthy Polish Caucasian nonagenarians and centenarians. The newly constructed database served as a control, providing a comparison for variant frequencies in the Polish population. The diagnostic yield for the selected group of IRD patients reached 64.9%. The study uncovered the most common pathogenic variants in
