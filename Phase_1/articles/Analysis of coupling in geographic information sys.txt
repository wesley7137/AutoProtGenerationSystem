Title: Analysis of coupling in geographic information systems based on WASPAS method for bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic Aczel-Alsina power aggregation operators.
Abstract: The model of bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic set is a very famous and dominant principle to cope with vague and uncertain information. The bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic set contained the positive membership function, negative membership function, and linguistic variable, where the technique of fuzzy sets to bipolar fuzzy sets are the special cases of the bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic set. In this manuscript, we describe the model of Aczel-Alsina operational laws for bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic values based on Aczel-Alsina t-norm and Aczel-Alsina t-conorm. Additionally, we compute the Aczel-Alsina power aggregation operators based on bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic data, called bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic Aczel-Alsina power averaging operator, bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic Aczel-Alsina power weighted averaging operator, bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic Aczel-Alsina power geometric operator, and bipolar complex fuzzy linguistic Aczel-Alsina power weighted geometric operator with some dominant and fundamental laws such as idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness. Moreover, we initiate the model of the Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment technique with the help of consequent theory. In the context of geographic information systems and spatial information systems, coupling aims to find out the relationships among different components within a geographic information system, where coupling can occur at many stages, for instance, spatial coupling, data coupling, and functional coupling. To evaluate the above dilemma, we perform the model of multi-attribute decision-making for invented operators to compute the best technique for addressing geographic information systems. In the last, we deliberate some numerical examples for comparing the ranking results of proposed and prevailing techniques.
