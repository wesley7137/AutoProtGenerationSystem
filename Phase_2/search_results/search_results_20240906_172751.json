      "title": "Correlated pion-proton pair emission off hot and dense QCD matter",
      "abstract": "  In this letter we report the first multi-differential measurement of\ncorrelated pion-proton pairs from 2 billion Au+Au collisions at \\sqrt{s_{NN}} =\n2.42 GeV collected with HADES. In this energy regime the population of\n\\Delta(1232) resonances plays an important role in the way energy is\ndistributed between intrinsic excitation energy and kinetic energy of the\nhadrons in the fireball. The triple differential d3N/dM{\\pi}pdpTdy\ndistributions of correlated {\\pi}p pairs have been determined by subtracting\nthe {\\pi}p combinatorial background using an iterative method. The\ninvariant-mass distributions in the \\Delta(1232) mass region show strong\ndeviations from a Breit-Wigner function with vacuum width and mass. The yield\nof correlated pion-proton pairs exhibits a complex isospin, rapidity and\ntransverse-momentum dependence. In the invariant mass range 1.1 < Minv (GeV/c2)\n< 1.4, the yield is found to be similar for {\\pi}+p and {\\pi}-p pairs, and to\nfollow a power law <Apart>^{\\alpha}, where <Apart> is the mean number of\nparticipating nucleons. The exponent {\\alpha} depends strongly on the pair\ntransverse momentum (pT) while its pT-integrated and charge-averaged value is\n{\\alpha} = 1.5 \\pm 0.08stat \\pm 0.2sys.\n"

      "title": "A gravitational-wave standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant",
      "abstract": "  The detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic\nwaves heralds the age of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. On 17\nAugust 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strong\nsignal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 seconds\nafter the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region\nof the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the\ngravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical\nastronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient\nsignal within $\\sim 10$ arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messenger\nobservations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, the\ngravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure the\nHubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate of\nthe Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental\nimportance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the source\ninferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity\ninferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data. This\napproach does not require any form of cosmic \"distance ladder;\" the\ngravitational wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out\nto cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical\ndistance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be\n$70.0^{+12.0}_{-8.0} \\, \\mathrm{km} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$\n(maximum a posteriori and 68% credible interval). This is consistent with\nexisting measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additional\nstandard-siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will provide\nprecision constraints of this important cosmological parameter.\n"

      "abstract": "  Gravitational waves enable tests of general relativity in the highly\ndynamical and strong-field regime. Using events detected by LIGO-Virgo up to 1\nOctober 2019, we evaluate the consistency of the data with predictions from the\ntheory. We first establish that residuals from the best-fit waveform are\nconsistent with detector noise, and that the low- and high-frequency parts of\nthe signals are in agreement. We then consider parametrized modifications to\nthe waveform by varying post-Newtonian and phenomenological coefficients,\nimproving past constraints by factors of ${\\sim}2$; we also find consistency\nwith Kerr black holes when we specifically target signatures of the\nspin-induced quadrupole moment. Looking for gravitational-wave dispersion, we\ntighten constraints on Lorentz-violating coefficients by a factor of\n${\\sim}2.6$ and bound the mass of the graviton to $m_g \\leq 1.76 \\times\n10^{-23} \\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ with 90% credibility. We also analyze the properties\nof the merger remnants by measuring ringdown frequencies and damping times,\nconstraining fractional deviations away from the Kerr frequency to $\\delta\n\\hat{f}_{220} = 0.03^{+0.38}_{-0.35}$ for the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and\n$\\delta \\hat{f}_{221} = 0.04^{+0.27}_{-0.32}$ for the first overtone;\nadditionally, we find no evidence for postmerger echoes. Finally, we determine\nthat our data are consistent with tensorial polarizations through a\ntemplate-independent method. When possible, we assess the validity of general\nrelativity based on collections of events analyzed jointly. We find no evidence\nfor new physics beyond general relativity, for black hole mimickers, or for any\nunaccounted systematics.\n"

      "abstract": "Growth factor holds great promise for bone regeneration, and spatiotemporal control of their expressing through site-specific reactions is crucial but challenging for on-demand therapy. In this study, we present the development of a novel unnatural amino acids (UAAs)-triggered therapeutic switch (UATS) system, composed of an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA-synthase (aaRS)-tRNA pair and a bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene harboring premature stop codon, which enable in situ and on-demand initiation of the expression of BMP2. The resulting UATS system allowed specifically control of base expressing on the BMP2 mRNA that switched to the BMP2 protein with complete structure and function to facilitate bone regeneration. Our investigations showed that the UATS system exhibits remarkable attributes of rapid, sensitive, reversible, and sustained BMP2 expression both in vitro and in vivo settings. Moreover, the implantation of microencapsulated cells with UATS system is applied to a mouse femur defect model, demonstrating high effciency in controlled expressing of BMP2 protein and substantial repair of bone defect following oral administration of UAAs. Therefore, our findings underscore the great potential of UATS system for on-demand awakening of functional growth factor, thus offering promising prospects in the realm of regenerative medicine."

      "title": "Rescue of Mitochondrial SIRT3 Ameliorates Ischemia-like Injury in Human Endothelial Cells.",
      "abstract": "Structural and functional alterations of vasculature caused by age-related factors is critically involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. The longevity genes sirtuins (SIRTs) are extensively investigated in aging-associated pathologies, but their distinct roles in ischemic stroke still remain to be clarified. To address this question, we applied oxygen and glucose deprived/reperfusion (OGD/R) to induce ischemic injury in human endothelial cells (ECs), which are the main component of vasculature in the brain. The results showed that OGD/R led to various damages to ECs, including compromised cell viability, increased LDH release, overproduced ROS, enhanced apoptosis and caspase activity. Meanwhile, the expression of mitochondrial SIRT3 was robustly decreased in ECs after OGD/R treatment. Consistently, rescue of SIRT3 by ectopic expression, but not nuclear SIRT1, in ECs reversed the OGD/R-induced cell damage. Interestingly, some front-line drugs for ischemic stroke, including clopidogrel, aspirin and dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), also rescued SIRT3 and reduced OGD/R-induced endothelial injury, suggesting that the recovery of SIRT3 expression was critical for the protection of these drugs. Moreover, our results demonstrated that 10-hydroxy-NBP (OHNBP), a major metabolite of NBP, showed better blood-brain barrier crossing capability than NBP, but still retained the effects on SIRT3 by NBP. Together, our results suggested that SIRT3 may serve as a potential novel target for treatment of ischemic stroke."

      "title": "Novel pharmacotherapy: NNI-362, an allosteric p70S6 kinase stimulator, reverses cognitive and neural regenerative deficits in models of aging and disease.",
      "abstract": "Aging is known to slow the neurogenic capacity of the hippocampus, one of only two mammalian adult neurogenic niches. The reduction of adult-born neurons with age may initiate cognitive decline progression which is exacerbated in chronic neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD). With physiologic neurogenesis diminished, but still viable in aging, non-invasive therapeutic modulation of this neuron regeneration process remains possible. The discovery of truly novel neuron regenerative therapies could be identified through phenotypic screening of small molecules that promote adult-born neurons from human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). By identifying neuron-generating therapeutics and potentially novel mechanism of actions, therapeutic benefit could be confirmed through in vivo proof-of-concept studies. The key aging and longevity mTOR/p70S6 kinase axis, a commonly targeted pathway, is substrate for potential selective kinase modulators to promote new hippocampal neurons from NPCs. The highly regulated downstream substrate of mTOR, p70S6 kinase, directly controls pleiotropic cellular activities, including translation and cell growth. Stimulating this kinase, selectively in an adult neurogenic niche, should promote NPC proliferation, and cell growth and survival in the hippocampus. Studies of kinase profiling and immunocytochemistry of human progenitor neurogenesis suggest that the novel small molecule NNI-362 stimulates p70S6 kinase phosphorylation, which, in turn, promotes proliferation and differentiation of NPCs to neurons. NNI-362 promoted the associative reversal of age- and disease-related cognitive deficits in aged mice and Down syndrome-modeled mice. This oral, allosteric modulator may ultimately be beneficial for age-related neurodegenerative disorders involving hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment, specifically AD, by promoting endogenous hippocampal regeneration."

      "title": "TXNL6 is a novel oxidative stress-induced reducing system for methionine sulfoxide reductase a repair of \u03b1-crystallin and cytochrome C in the eye lens.",
      "abstract": "A key feature of many age-related diseases is the oxidative stress-induced accumulation of protein methionine sulfoxide (PMSO) which causes lost protein function and cell death. Proteins whose functions are lost upon PMSO formation can be repaired by the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) which is a key regulator of longevity. One disease intimately associated with PMSO formation and loss of MsrA activity is age-related human cataract. PMSO levels increase in the eye lens upon aging and in age-related human cataract as much as 70% of total lens protein is converted to PMSO. MsrA is required for lens cell maintenance, defense against oxidative stress damage, mitochondrial function and prevention of lens cataract formation. Essential for MsrA action in the lens and other tissues is the availability of a reducing system sufficient to catalytically regenerate active MsrA. To date, the lens reducing system(s) required for MsrA activity has not been defined. Here, we provide evidence that a novel thioredoxin-like protein called thioredoxin-like 6 (TXNL6) can serve as a reducing system for MsrA repair of the essential lens chaperone \u03b1-crystallin/sHSP and mitochondrial cytochrome c. We also show that TXNL6 is induced at high levels in human lens epithelial cells exposed to H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress. Collectively, these data suggest a critical role for TXNL6 in MsrA repair of essential lens proteins under oxidative stress conditions and that TXNL6 is important for MsrA defense protection against cataract. They also suggest that MsrA uses multiple reducing systems for its repair activity that may augment its function under different cellular conditions."
