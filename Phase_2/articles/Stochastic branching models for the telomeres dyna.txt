Title: Stochastic branching models for the telomeres dynamics in a model

Abstract:   Telomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides at the end of chromosomes,
whose evolution over time is intrinsically related to biological ageing. In
most cells, with each cell division, telomeres shorten due to the so-called end
replication problem, which can lead to replicative senescence and a variety of
age-related diseases. On the other hand, in certain cells, the presence of the
enzyme telomerase can lead to the lengthening of telomeres, which may delay or
prevent the onset of such diseases but can also increase the risk of cancer.In
this article, we propose a stochastic representation of this biological model,
which takes into account multiple chromosomes per cell, the effect of
telomerase, different cell types and the dependence of the distribution of
telomere length on the dynamics of the process. We study theoretical properties
of this model, including its long-term behaviour. In addition, we investigate

quantities, such as the Hayflick limit and the Malthusian parameter of the

Abstract
Telomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides at the end of chromosomes, whose
evolution over time is intrinsically related to biological ageing. In most cells, with each
cell division, telomeres shorten due to the so-called end replication problem, which can
lead to replicative senescence and a variety of age-related diseases. On the other hand,
in certain cells, the presence of the enzyme telomerase can lead to the lengthening of
telomeres, which may delay or prevent the onset of such diseases but can also increase
the risk of cancer.
In this article, we propose a stochastic representation of this biological model, which
takes into account multiple chromosomes per cell, the effect of telomerase, different cell
types and the dependence of the distribution of telomere length on the dynamics of
the process. We study theoretical properties of this model, including its long-term
behaviour. In addition, we investigate numerically the impact of the model paramet-
ers on biologically relevant quantities, such as the Hayflick limit and the Malthusian
parameter of the population of cells.

1 Introduction
Telomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides located at the ends of linear chromosomes
that act as protective caps to ensure the genomic stability. As cells divide, telomeres gradu-

tosis [42, 21, 63], processes implicated in a number of age-related diseases such as cardiovas-
cular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases [19, 28, 52]. In addition, research has shown
that factors such as lifestyle, genetics and oxidative stress can also impact telomere length
dynamics [50, 47, 38].
On the other hand, some cell types can express an enzyme called telomerase. This
DNA polymerase has the ability to add telomeric repeats to the end of telomeres during
DNA replication, which can compensate the effects of telomere shortening but also plays an
important role in the development and evolution of cancer [34, 6].
In the past 30 years, mathematical modelling has played an important role in understand-
ing the long-term behaviour of the distribution of telomere length in cells and the associated
health implications. One of the earliest (deterministic) models for the evolution of telomere
lengths was given in [37], which mirrored the results seen in in vitroexperiments. Shortly
after, Arinoetal. [1]andOlofssonandKimmel[41]reframedthismodelintermsofabranch-
ing process to obtain both exact and asymptotic results for the behaviour of telomeres. Since
then, there have been a wide range of stochastic models for telomere lengths, both with and
without the presence of telomerase, for the purpose of understanding the role of the shortest
telomere in senescence [7, 14], calculating the time until senescence [22], parameter inference
[36] and calculating the stationary distribution [36]. We also refer the reader to [43, 61, 44]
for computational analysis of both deterministic and stochastic models.
In this paper, our aim is to propose a mathematical model that describes the evolution
in continuous time of the whole population of cells, whose dynamics depend explicitly on the
lengths of their telomeres. This is in accordance with recent empirical evidence [7, 14, 62],
which suggests a strong link between the length of the shortest telomere and the cell’s
behaviour. In addition, we also allow for different cell types, multiple chromosomes per cell
andtake into account the effect of telomerase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
mathematical model that takes all these components into account simultaneously.
Among the models in the aforementioned literature, some of them describe the whole cell
population, while others describe a single cell lineage. While both approaches are relevant,
we emphasize that the latter approach does not appropriately describe the distribution of
the whole population when reproduction and/or senescence rates of a cell depend on its
telomere lengths. This is due to an imbalance of mass compared to the whole population of
cells. To counteract this issue, one needs to appropriately weight the single linear process, as
in themany-to-one formula . In the setting of telomere dynamics, this is given in Lemma 3.3,
which allows one to represent the first moment of the entire cell population by the average
behaviour of a typical trajectory in the population, appropriately weighted. This result
allows one to more easily analyse the behaviour of the branching process, and provides a
useful tool for numerical simulations.
One of the main mathematical contributions of this paper, Theorem 4.5, is related to
the asymptotic behaviour of the first moment of the particle system. In the case that
telomerase is present and compensates the attrition of telomeres, so that the population
grows indefinitely, we show two things. Firstly, the distribution of an average cell and its
telomere lengths converges with time, and secondly, the first moment of the population size
grows asymptotically exponentially fast. This analysis is related to the theory of quasi-
2stationary distributions (see e.g. [12, 56, 39]).
We also present numerical simulations of the model, both with and without telomerase.
In the case where it has very little impact or is not present at all, the population eventually
stabilizes due to the fact that cells can no longer divide when their telomeres are too short.
In this case, the number of times the population doubles, also called the Hayflick limit
[29, 48, 54], is finite. Thus, we investigate the influence of the model parameters on the
Hayflick limit. On the other hand, when telomerase is present, we study its influence on
the asymptotic growth rate of the population and the stabilization of the distribution of an
average cell and its telomere lengths, illustrating Theorem 4.5 in practice.
The rest of the paper is set out as follows. In Section 2, we present the specific model
that we will work with throughout the paper, presenting first the biological mechanism for
DNA replication at the level of chromosomes, followed by the stochastic process describing
the population of cells. This model takes into account the telomere length distribution of
chromosomes, as well as the cell’s ability to divide or not. In addition, we allow for the
possibility that the dynamics depend on the absence/presence of telomerase. Section 3
is devoted to the mathematical analysis of the first moment of the mathematical model,
leading to the many-to-one formula (see Lemma 3.3). In Section 4, we establish and prove
our main mathematical result, which characterises the long-term behaviour of our process
(see Theorem 4.5). In particular, we describe the growth rate of the average number of
particles in the system and the corresponding stationary distribution. Section 5 contains
the numerical simulations, which illustrate the impact of the model parameters on 1) the
Hayflicklimit(the number oftimes thepopulationdoubles), 2) theasymptoticgrowthrate of
the population, and 3) the asymptotic distribution of telomere lengths in the cell population.
Finally, in Section 6, we discuss our model, results and possible future work and extensions.
In addition, we alert the reader to the table of notation in Appendix B, which collects the
main parameters used for the simulations in Section 5.
2 The model
2.1 The biological model
In this section, we describe the biological DNA replication mechanism we adhere to through-
out the article. For concreteness, we will describe the replication mechanism that occurs
in human cells, however, the mathematical model we consider in the next section is robust
enough to apply to other organisms. We will also only describe the relevant aspects of the
DNA replication process, and we refer the reader to [25, 3] and references therein for further
details.
Human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, each composed of a DNA strand whose
extremities are called telomeres. Each strand of the DNA double helix has a 3’ and a 5’ end.
Due to the antiparallel structure of the double helix, the 3’ end of one strand opposes the 5’
end of the other strand. Moreover, the 3’ end overhangs the opposing 5’ end (see Figure 1a).
Starting from the centre of the chromosome (referred to as the origin of replication), the
DNA helix is ‘unzipped’ in the direction of the telomeres, creating two ‘Y’ shapes, each called
a replication fork (see Figure 1b). The two separated strands will then act as templates for
3an enzyme (DNA polymerase) to make new complementary DNA strands, resulting in two
copies of the original chromosome.
The orientation of the DNA helix means that when it is unzipped, in one direction it
unzips from the 3’ to the 5’ end, which will form the leadingstrand, while in the other
direction the helix is unzipped in the 5’ to 3’ direction, and will form the laggingstrand.
Due to the way DNA polymerase replicates DNA and the antiparallel nature of a DNA
helix, the mechanism is slightly different for each of the two strands. Indeed, as the DNA
polymerase synthesises the leading strand, DNA fragments are added continuously to form
the new complementary (antiparallel) strand from the origin to the end of the 5’ end of the
template. Note that the new complementary strand will be shorter than the original one
since DNA polymerase can only use the 3’ to 5’ strand as a template, resulting in the loss
of the original overhang. In order to re-establish the overhang, an enzyme called nuclease
removes the end of the template 5’ end so that the new 3’ is longer. On the other hand,
whenDNApolymerasesynthesisesthelaggingstrand, itdoessoinseparatedsegments, called
Okazaki fragments, using a ‘back-stitch’ type method. Due to the discontinuous nature of
the replication along the lagging strand, DNA cannot be replicated all the way to the end of
the template strand, hence also resulting in an overhang of the 3’ end. We refer the reader
to Figures 1a, 1b and 1c for a diagram of these steps, as well as [25] for further details and
references.
Thus, as a result of the mechanism described above, telomeres become shorter with each
cell division. This is known as the end replication problem . When the shortest telomere in
a cell becomes too short, the cell is unable to divide any further (see [7, 30]), since another
division would risk damaging the DNA. When this occurs, the cell becomes senescent, which
we refer to as deactivation in the rest of the paper. Thus, if the shortest telomere in each
cell falls below a certain threshold, the number of cells in the population ceases to increase.
This leads to a concept called the Hayflick limit, which is defined as the number of times a
population of cells can double (before cell division is no longer possible).
In certain cells, such as stem cells, the majority of cancer cells and some somatic cells,
an enzyme called telomerase is present, which provides a mechanism by which telomeres can
lengthen. In these cells, after DNA replication has occurred, telomerase has the ability to
add new nucleotides to the 3’ end. After a certain number of nucleotides have been added,
the complementary sequence of nucleotides is then added to the corresponding 5’ end (see
Figure 1d, and [5, 46] for further details).
As discussed in [51], the number of nucleotides added varies between a few to more than
100 nucleotides, and the number added is independent of the length of the strand. However,
when telomerase is present, it does not lengthen every telomere in the cell (as illustrated in
Figure 1d); it is more likely to elongate a telomere if the telomere is shorter (we also refer
the reader to the telomere length regulation model proposed in [26]).
At the end of the replication process (including the possible elongation of telomeres), the
resulting object is a pair of chromosomes, with one being given to each of the daughter cells.

52.2 Branching model
We now propose a stochastic model for the evolution of a population of cells and their chro-
mosomes based on the biological mechanism presented in the previous section. In particular,
we will define a branching process that mimics the behaviour of a population of dividing
cells as a function of their telomeres.
We first introduce some notation in order to keep track of the telomere lengths in each
chromosome. Recall that the 3’ end overhangs the opposing 5’ end of a DNA strand. We
denote byωthe length of this overhang and assume that it is the same for all telomeres. We
will also write (m,n)to denote a chromosome whose 3’ ends are of length mandn. Using
this notation, it follows that at one end of the chromosome the 3’ end and its opposing 5’
end are of length mandm−ω, respectively, while at the other end of the chromosome, they
are of length nandn−ω, see Figure 1a.
If telomerase is not expressed then, after replication, the chromosome (m,n)gives rise
to two daughter chromosomes (m,n−ω)and(m−ω,n)(see Figure 1c). However, when
telomerase is present, each of the four new telomeres can be elongated. Recall that if the
3’ end of one strand is elongated then the complementary 5’ end will also be elongated,
keeping an overhang of size ω. We will assume that the four telomeres (two per daughter
chromosome) are elongated independently of the other telomeres, and with a probability that
depends on its length. Moreover, the size of the elongation is assumed to be independent of
the length of the telomere.
To represent this mathematically, let q(ℓ)denote the probability that a telomere with
lengthℓwill be elongated, and let χℓdenote a Bernoulli random variable with parameter
q(ℓ). Then, given χℓ= 1, we letLdenote the (random) quantity added to the telomere,
whose law is given by a probability distribution µfonN={0,1,2,...}. Writing Λℓ=χℓL,
the two resulting daughter chromosomes are thus given by (m+ Λm,n−ω+ Λ′
n−ω)and
(m−ω+ Λ′′
m−ω,n+ Λ′′′
n)(see Figure 1d), where (Λℓ)ℓ∈N,(Λ′
ℓ)ℓ∈N,(Λ′′
ℓ)ℓ∈Nand(Λ′′′
ℓ)ℓ∈Nare
mutually independent and identically distributed. In the example of Figure 1d, Λ′′′
n= 0.
Remark2.1.Accordingtotheempiricalevidencepresentedin[51], wechoosethedistribution
µfto be independent of the length of the telomere ℓ. However, the mathematical results
and proofs developed in the next section can be easily adapted to the more general setting
where the distribution does depend on ℓ.
Apart from their telomere lengths, cells are also represented by their state: the cell
can be in an active or a non-active state. In an active state, it can undergo replication,
deactivation (i.e. senescence1) , or be removed from the system. In a non-active state (i.e.
after senescence), the cell cannot replicate, and can thus only be removed from the system.
With this in mind, we now define our model at the level of the cells. Let Ntbe the
number of cells in the system at time t≥0. The collection of cells will be denoted by
{(ci(t),xi(t)) :i= 1,...,Nt}, whereci(t)represents the lengths of the telomeres in the i-th
cell at time tandxi(t)represents its state (active or non-active). More precisely, letting K
denote the number of chromosomes in a cell, we write ci(t) = (mi,j(t),ni,j(t))K
j=1∈(N×N)K,
where (mi,j(t),ni,j(t))represents the jthchromosome in cell iat timet≥0. Moreover, if
1Cellular senescence is defined as an irreversible arrest of cell proliferation [27].
6theithcell is active we set xi(t) =a, and otherwise xi(t) =na. Note that Ntalso counts
the number of non-active cells. We assume that if the minimum telomere length of a cell is
smaller than a given value Lmin≥ω, then it is inactive.
For a given element c= (mj,nj)K
j=1∈(N×N)K, we let minc:= min{mj,nj,1≤j≤K}
denote the minimum telomere length in the cell and maxc:= max{mj,nj,1≤j≤K}the
maximum telomere length in the cell. We thus denote by E=Ea∪Enathe set of possible
‘values’ a cell can take, with EaandEnadenoting the set of values of the active cells and
non-active cells, respectively, i.e.
Ea:=/braceleftig
c∈(N×N)K: minc≥Lmin/bracerightig
×{a}andEna:= (N×N)K×{na}.
Hence, a cell is represented by an element of the form (c,x)∈E.
Let
Xt:=Nt/summationdisplay
i=1δ(ci(t),xi(t)), t≥0,
denote the population of cells at time t, which is an element of M(E), the set of non-negative
discrete measures on E. The system evolves as a branching process so that, given their point
of creation, cells evolve independently of each other according to the following dynamics.

law described in the previous subsection. If minci<L min, fori∈{1,2}, then the cell
becomes non-active immediately, and if minci≥Lmin, we assume that the cell is, as
its mother cell, active. Hence, the term δ(c,a)ofXt−is replaced by
1minc1≥Lmin×δ(c1,a)+ 1minc1<Lmin×δ(c1,na)+ 1minc2≥Lmin×δ(c2,a)+ 1minc2<Lmin×δ(c2,na).
A non-active cell (c,na)∈Enaremains in the same state until it is removed from the
system, at rate dna(t,c), at timet≥0:
Xt=Xt−−δ(c,na).
73 Mean semigroup of the branching process
3.1 Evolution equation of the mean semigroup
In this section, we consider the dynamics of the expectation of the branching process Xt.
We thus define the expectation semigroup associated to this process. For (c,x)∈Eand a
bounded measurable function g:E→R, set
ψu,t[g](c,x):=Eu,(c,x)[⟨g,Xt⟩]:=Eu,(c,x)/bracketleftiggNt/summationdisplay

where Eu,(c,x)is the expectation operator associated to the law Pu,(c,x)(·) :=P(·|Xu=δ(c,x)),
i.e. the law of the process whose initial population is composed of a single cell, (c,x)∈Eat
timeu.
In order to understand the evolution of the mean semigroup (ψu,t)0≤u≤t, we introduce
the following assumption that ensures only a finite number of events can occur in finite time
intervals.
Assumption 3.1. The birth, deactivation and removal rates, ba,sa,daanddna, are bounded.
Based on the dynamics described in the previous section, we have the following pro-
position, which gives the evolution equation for (ψu,t)0≤u≤t. In what follows, we say that
the semigroup ψisbounded in time if∥ψu,t[g]∥∞<∞for all positive bounded measurable

8Proof.The proof is similar to [13, §6]. Let us recall the main arguments. By Assumption 3.1,
ψis bounded in time. By conditioning ψu,t+t′at timetand applying the Markov property, it
is a straightforward exercise to show that (ψu,t)t≥u≥0is a semigroup. To show that it satisfies
(2) first consider the case when x=a. Splitting the expectation semigroup on the first event
(branching, deactivation or removal), we have

where the second term follows from an application of the branching property and the strong
Markov property. Applying Theorem 2.1 in [32], we obtain equation (2) for the case x=a.
For the case where x=na, the cell can only remain non-active or be removed from the
system. Thus splitting ψu,t[g](c,na)on the first time the cell is removed from the system
and again, applying [32, Theorem 2.1], we obtain

that is equation (2) for the case x=na.

3.2 Many-to-one
We now consider a many-to-one representation for the semigroup (ψu,t)t≥u≥0. The many-to-
one formula offers another representation for the first moment of the system of cells via a
9weighted jump process. The motivation for considering this second representation is two-
fold. Firstly, as we shall see in the next section, it more easily allows us to characterise the
long-term behaviour of the branching process: indeed, considering the long-term behaviour
of a single (weighted) trajectory is much more tractable than that of the entire system of
cells. Secondly, we will later simulate our model using interacting particle systems that are
based on multiple copies of single trajectories.
Without further ado, consider the process (Ct,Xt)t≥0that evolves as a pure jump process
inE∪{∂}, where (Ct,Xt) =∂means that the cell is removed from the system and does not
evolve further (in particular, the point ∂is absorbing). The dynamics of this process are as
follows.
•When in configuration (c,a) = ((mj,nj)K
j=1,a)∈Ea, the process
–jumps with rate 2ba(t,c), at timet, to(c′,x′)with
c′= (mj−ωBj+ Λmj−ωBj,j,nj−ω(1−Bj) + Λ′

–switches with rate da(t,c)from (c,a)to∂.
•The process in a configuration (c,na)switches to ∂with ratedna(t,c).
Note that for active cells, when a jump occurs at rate 2ba, the cell jumps from Ct−to the cell
c1defined as in (3). Note that as the law of c1andc2are the same, it is equivalent to choose
the cellc1with probability 1/2and the cell c2with probability 1/2. Then, if minc′≥Lmin,
the cell remains active ( Xt=a), and otherwise the cell becomes inactive ( Xt=na).
LetPu,(c,x)denotethelawofthisprocesswhenstartedfromasinglecellwithconfiguration
(c,x)at timeu, with corresponding expectation operator Eu,(c,x). Similarly to the proof of
Proposition 3.2, it follows that the linear semigroup (φu,t)t≥u≥0associated to (Ct,Xt)t≥0
satisfies

this.

also solves equation (2), and hence ψu,t=ϕu,tfor eacht≥u≥0.
The proof follows by either using similar methods to those used in Proposition 3.2 or by
applying [32, Theorem 2.1] to (6) and so we leave it as an exercise for the reader.
4 Long-term behaviour
This section is devoted to studying the asymptotic stability of the telomere length profile,
as stated in Theorem 4.5 below. For simplicity, we only consider the time homogeneous
dynamics (hence replacing ba(t,c)byba(c),da(t,c)byda(c),ψs,tbyψt−sand so on). This
will allow us to make a connection to the theory of quasi-stationary distributions. We refer
the reader to [18, 16, 17, 4, 9, 57] for time inhomogeneous versions of this theory.
In order to state our main result, we need some additional assumptions. We first make
a technical assumption (Assumption 4.1) on the telomere lengthening caused by telomerase,
which will ensure that the process is irreducible in Ea(see Lemma 4.6 below). The second as-
sumption (Assumption 4.2) then imposes that the process is supercritical (in the usual sense,
made precise below). Finally we make assumptions which guarantee quasi-compactness (As-
sumptions 4.3 and 4.4).
Assumption 4.1. We assume that
1. there exists btel>ωinNsuch andµf{btel}>0andµf{btel−1}>0,
2.ba(c)>0for all (c,a)∈Ea,
3.0<q(i)<1for alli≥Lmin.
We will soon see that under Assumptions 3.1 and 4.1, the process is irreducible on Ea
(see Lemma 4.6) and, by construction, its complement is absorbing. Hence we can define
λ0= inf/braceleftbigg
λ∈R,such that lim inf
t→∞e−λtψt[1F](c,a)<+∞/bracerightbigg
, (8)
which does not depend on (c,a)∈Eanor on the (arbitrary) non-empty finite set F⊂Ea.
The informal interpretation of λ0is that it measures the asymptotic exponential growth of
the expected number of active cells in the population. We say that the process is supercritical
whenλ0>0,subcritical whenλ0<0andcriticalwhenλ0= 0. The value λ0is sometimes
referred to as the Malthusian parameter.
11In the rest of this section, we focus on the supercritical case, which corresponds to expo-
nential growth of the average number of active cells (such as expanding cancerous tumour
[6] or germinal cells [31, Fig. 1]).
Assumption 4.2. We haveλ0>0.
Next, we introduce an assumption on the moments of µf, the law of the length added to
telomeres when telomerase acts.
Assumption 4.3. We assume that there exists α0>1
ωln∥ba∥∞
λ0such thatµfadmits an
exponential moment of order α0>0, i.e.
/summationdisplay
n≥0µf{n}exp(α0n)<+∞.
We conclude with an assumption on the probability that telomerase acts on a telomere,
depending on its length.
Assumption 4.4. We assume that the probability of telomerase activity, q(i), decreases to
0wheni→+∞.
Note that Assumption 4.4 is satisfied, in particular, when q(i)decreases geometrically
fast ini, as suggested in the telomere length regulation model [26].
We are now ready to state our main result.
Theorem 4.5. Suppose Assumptions 3.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 hold. Then there exists a
functionη:E→R, positive on Eaand vanishing on Ena, a probability measure νonE, and
a functionV:E→[1,∞)such that, for all g:E→Rsatisfying|g|≤V, we have
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglee−λ0tψt[g](c,x)−η(c,x)ν[g]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤Ce−γtV(c,x), t≥0,(c,x)∈E,
whereC,γare positive constants. In addition, one can choose Vsuch that, for some k≥
1,α> 0,
V(c,na) = 1andV(c,a) = exp
αK/summationdisplay
j=1/parenleftig
(mj−k+ω)++ (nj−k+ω)+/parenrightig
.
We prove this Theorem in three steps. The first takes the form of a Lemma that shows
that the process is irreducible on Ea. The second gives the asymptotic behavior for the
process restricted to the active particles (Proposition 4.7). Finally the proof of Theorem 4.5
follows from Theorem 3.1 of [10].
Lemma 4.6. Under Assumptions 3.1 and 4.1, the set Eais irreducible for the process
(Ct,Xt)t≥0defined in Section 3.2.
12Proof.Let(c,x) = ((mj,nj)K
j=1,a)∈Ea. Let us denote by τ1<τ 2the two first jump times
of the process (where τ2= +∞if(Cτ1,Xτ1) =∂). Then, for any fixed t0>0and any
(A1×···×AK)×{a}∈Ea, we have
P(c,x)((Ct0,Xt0)∈(A1×···×AK)×{a})
≥P(c,x)(τ1<t0<τ2,(Ct0,Xt0)∈(A1×···×AK)×{a})

Note that due to the second part of Assumption 4.1, inf 2ba>0.
We observe that, restricting to the events {Bj= 1,Λ′
nj,j= 0}(i.e., we have attrition −ω
on the left-hand side of the chromosome and telomerase does not act on the right-hand side)
and{Bj= 0,Λmj,j= 0}, we obtain

.
This process can jump with positive probability from (mj,nj)to(mj+ω(btel−ω),nj)inω
steps and from (mj+ω(btel−ω),nj)to(mj,nj)inbtel−ωsteps, so that there is path of
lengthbtellinking (mj,nj)to itself. Similarly, there exists a path of length btel−1linking
(mj,nj)to itself. This implies that the process is aperiodic. Moreover, the process can jump
from (mj,nj)to(mj+ω(btel−ω−1) + 1,nj)inωsteps, and then come back to (mj+ 1,nj)
inbtel−ω−1steps. This shows that the process can reach (mj+ 1,nj)from (mj,nj).
Similarly, one shows that the process can reach (mj−1,nj),(mj,nj+ 1),(mj,nj−1)from
(mj,nj)in less than btelsteps. In particular, we deduce that, for all (m1,n1),..., (mK,nK)
and(m′

where theZiare chosen independent. Using the definition of µ(mj,nj)and the inequality (9),
we deduce that, for all (c′,a)∈Ea,
P(c,x)(Cn0t0=c′,Xn0t0=a)>0.
13In the next proposition, we use the notation
G:=/braceleftig
c∈(N×N)K,minc>Lmin/bracerightig
to denote the set of possible values of active cells.
Proposition 4.7. Suppose Assumptions 3.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 hold. Then there exists a
positive function ηa:G→R, a probability measure νaonG, and a function Va:G→[1,∞)
such that, for all g:G→Rsatisfying|g|≤Va,

whereg0(c,x) :=g(c)1c∈G,x=a, and where C,γare positive constants. In addition, one can

Va(c) = exp

.
Remark 4.8.The above proposition is stated for λ0>0which corresponds to exponentially
growing populations, which is our main focus. However, a straightforward adaptation of
the proof shows that the result also holds if inf(da+sa+λ0)>0. In addition, numerical
simulations suggest that this result may hold in a more general context, at least for some
choices of the model parameters and without restriction on λ0(see Remark A.1).
Proof.In order to prove the proposition, we consider the semigroup on L∞(G)(the space
of bounded measurable functions on G), defined, for all c∈Gand all bounded measurable

The irreducibility of/tildewideCis a direct consequence of the irreducibility of Cproved in Lemma 4.6.
In particular, we can define
/tildewideλ0= inf/braceleftbigg
λ∈R,such that lim inf
t→∞e−λt/tildewideφt[1H](c)<+∞/bracerightbigg
,
independently of c∈Gand of the finite set H⊂G. We observe, by Lemma 3.3, (8) and
(10), that
/tildewideλ0=λ0−∥ba∥∞. (12)
Our aim is to apply Theorem 5.1 in [8]. In order to do so, it is sufficient to find a
Lyapunov type function, Va:G→[1,+∞), such that
LVa≤(/tildewideλ0−ε)Va+C1H, (13)
for someε >0and finiteH⊂G. Beware that the convention for the sign of λ0is not the
same in the reference. Indeed, the constant λ0therein is a decreasing parameter , while in our
case it refers to a growth parameter . Hence, one need to replace λ0by−λ0in Theorem 5.1
in [8] to reconcile with our setting.
In order to find Va, we setα∈/parenleftig

Now, choosing the finite set H:={c∈G,maxc≤k}, from (14) and (11), LVk≤Vk
which is bounded in the compact set H. We deduce that there exists a constant C > 0such
that (13) holds true for Va=Vk, which concludes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 4.5. In a similar manner to (10), consider the pure jump sub-Markov
process (¯Ct,¯Xt)t≥0onEevolving as (C,X)under E(c,x), but is removed from the system at an
additional rate∥ba∥∞−1x=aba(c,x). Denote by E(c,x)the expectation operator associated to
16this process, and by ¯φtthe semigroup on L∞(E)(the space of bounded measurable functions
onE), defined, for all (c,x)∈Eand all bounded measurable functions g:E→R, by
¯φt[g](c,x) :=e−∥bat∥∞ϕt[g](c,x) = E (c,x)/bracketleftig
g(¯Ct,¯Xt)1t<¯τ/bracketrightig
,
where ¯τdenotes the time at which the particle is removed from the system (¯Ct,¯Xt)t≥0.
Note that, before time Tna:= inf{t≥0,¯Xt=na}, the process ¯Ctevolves as the process
/tildewideCtintroduced in the proof of Proposition 4.7. Combining this fact with (10), (12) and
Proposition 4.7, we have

Next, we make use of Theorem 3.1 in [10] for the discrete time process (¯Cn,¯Xn)n∈N, in the
situation corresponding to Assumption A1 therein. In order to do so, we set D1=Ea,D2=
Ena,j0,P= 0,θ0,P=e−/tildewideλ0,γ=e−∥ba∥∞<θ 0,P,c1= 1,WR≡1(c,x)∈D2andWP=Va1(c,x)∈D1.
We deduce that for g:E→Rsuch that|g|≤V:=WP+WR,

Taking (c,x)∈Ea, we thus observe that νis a quasi-limiting distribution and hence a
quasi-stationary distribution for the process (this is a classical result from the theory of
quasi-stationary distributions, see for instance [39, 12, 56]). In particular, there exists λ≤0
such that Pν/parenleftig
(¯Ct,¯Xt)∈·, t< ¯τ/parenrightig
=eλtν(·), for allt≥0. The above convergence shows that
λ=/tildewideλ0and we deduce that ν[gh] =e/tildewideλ0hν[g]. Finally, we proved that

Up to a change in the constant Cand setting γ= ln1/β, this concludes the proof of the
theorem.
5 Numerical simulations
Thissectionisdedicatedtothenumericalexplorationofthetheoreticalresultsoftheprevious
section. In Section 5.1, we consider the model without telomerase (i.e. with q≡0) and
study its limiting population size, through the so-called Hayflick limit, as a function of
17the parameters of the model. In Section 5.2, we consider the model with telomerase and
study, first the values of the Malthusian parameter λ0, defined by (8), as a function of the
parameters of the model, and second the convergence of the process as stated by Theorem 4.5
whenλ0>0.
Note that under Assumption 4.2, the expected number of particles grows exponentially
and thus a naïve numerical simulation of the process is not appropriate. Instead, we use
an interacting particle approximation scheme based on genetic algorithms, described in Al-
gorithm 1 in appendix, which allows us to replace the mean semigroup by the average
behaviour of a fixed size population. We refer the reader to [16, 17] for detailed results and
methods on this type of algorithms.
For simulations presented in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, we compute the expectation of 100
runs of Algorithm 1 with N= 10000 particles. Where possible, we have chosen parameter
values that are consistent with empirical data or existing literature. In particular, the exper-
iments described in [11] suggest that ωshould be chosen in the range [12b,300b]. However,
when information on possible parameter values is not available, we have chosen the values
arbitrarily.
We remind the reader that we have included a table of notation in Appendix B containing
a description of the model parameters and a reference to where they were first introduced
in this article.
5.1 Without telomerase
In this section, we consider the model without telomerase. As such, this model describes the
dynamics of a population of cells whose telomere lengths can only decrease with time. More
precisely, we choose q≡0and by default
Lmin= 2kb, ω= 0.2kb, K= 46, c0=K/productdisplay
i=1(8kb,8kb), (17)
so that all the telomeres in the population have initial length28kb, and
sa(c) =e−(minc−Lmin)/rswithrs= 100, ba(c) = 1, dna(c) =da(c) = 0.(18)
In particular, when all the cells have (at least) one telomere shorter than Lmin, they are all
in a non-active state, and the population can no longer evolve.
One quantity of interest is the final size of the population, which we denote by N∞. The
Hayflick limit [29, 48] of a cell population describes the total number of doubling of the
population. Mathematically, we define this limit as
H= log2E(c0,a)[N∞], (19)
wherec0describes the telomere lengths of an initial cell. In what follows, we will investigate
(numerically) the dependence of the Hayflick limit on certain model parameters, namely the
number of chromosomes K, the minimal telomere length for active cells Lmin, the overhang
lengthω, and the parameter rsof the “deactivation” rate sa.
2The unit kb refers to 1kilobase, sometimes written as kbp for kilobase pair.
18Remark 5.1.In biological experiments, the Hayflick limit is better described by log2N∞
N0.
However, under mild assumptions,N∞
N0can be approximated by E/parenleftig
N∞
N0/parenrightig
when the initial
size of the population N0is large (this is a consequence of the law of large numbers and
the branching property in our model). In addition, if all the initial cells are in state (c0,a),
E/parenleftig
N∞
N0/parenrightig
=E(c0,a)[N∞]. This justifies our mathematical definition of the Hayflick limit H.
We first present the evolution of the expected population size for the above choice of
parameters, see Figure 2. In the initial population, all telomere lengths are sufficiently large
so that the non-active population is negligible. From (18), the expected population size
grows exponentially with rate ba(c) = 1(see the second figure in Figure 2 where the total
expected population size follows the red dotted line until t≈19). Then the growth slows
down until the population stabilises at E(c0,a)(N∞)(see figure on the left), which corresponds
to the time when the population of active cells vanishes (see figure on the right).

In Figure 3, we represent the Hayflick limit as a function of the number of chromosomes
K; the minimal length, Lmin, of telomeres in active cells; the overhang ω, and the parameter
rsassociated with the “deactivation” rate sa. We make the following observations.
•InFigure3a, weobservethattheHayflicklimitisdecreasingwithrespecttothenumber
of chromosomes K. This is not surprising since one expects that the larger the number
of chromosomes, the smaller (in law) the minimal telomere length in the cell. Therefore
increasing the number of chromosomes increases the probability of deactivation (with
our choice of sagiven by (18)), as well as the probability that a cell is ‘non-active’ after
a division.
With our choice for Lmin,ωandc0given in (17), the minimal theoretical value of
the Hayflick limit (when K→∞) is(8000−2000)/200 = 30 , however we observe
that it remains around 45for a large but realistic number of chromosomes. For the
case with 46 chromosomes, which corresponds to the setting of Figure 2, we observe
a Hayflick limit of 45.9, which is comparable to the experimentally measured interval
[40,60](see [29] and [58]).
19•In Figure 3b, we observe that the Hayflick limit decreases linearly with respect to
the minimal length Lminof active cells. This is due to the fact that increasing the
minimal telomere length of active cells increases the number of non-active cells and
hence decreases the number of times the population doubles.
•Similarly, the Hayflick limit is also decreasing with respect to the overhang ω(see
Figure 3c) as well as the parameter rsof the deactivation rate, sa(see Figure 3d).

in the computation of the Hayflick limit, which are slightly visible, mainly in Figures 3a and 3d.
5.2 With telomerase
We consider now the model withtelomerase and we choose default parameters satisfying
Assumptions 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4. Our values of q(ℓ)are derived from the empirical measures
20described in [51] and the mechanism described in [26]. We choose the following geomet-
ric distribution for the probability that telomerase lengthens a telomere, and the following
uniform distribution for the distribution of the size of the increase:
q(ℓ) =q02−(ℓ−Lmin)/Lminandµf=U([0,M]), (20)
whereq0∈[0,1]andM > 0. By default, we choose q0= 0.7,M= 600and the other
parameters remain as in (17) and (18).
Ifλ0>0then the expected population size goes to infinity at rate λ0and hence the
Hayflick limit is equal to infinity. On the other hand, if λ0<0, then the asymptotic
expected population size of active cells decreases exponentially fast and eventually goes
extinct. Finally, if λ0= 0, then the population of active cells is critical and does not
asymptotically increase nor decrease exponentially fast.
In order to understand the effect of the biological parameters on the behaviour of the
population (survival, growth rate, Hayflick limit), we compute λ0for different values of sa,
qandµf(equivalently, rs,q0andM, respectively). When λ0<0, we compute the Hayflick
limit and, when λ0>0, we illustrate the convergence of the telomere length distribution in
the population of cells to the limiting distribution ν, as stated in Theorem 4.5.
In Figure 4, we plot λ0as a function of the parameters q0,Mandrs. We make the
following observations.
•As expected, the eigenvalue λ0increases when the parameter q0increases, since this
increases then the probability of telomerase lengthening a telomere.
•Similarly, when Mincreases, so does λ0since this increases the upper bound on the
amount a telomere can be lengthened by.
•In the left-hand figure, we see that λ0decreases monotonically with rs, the parameter
that appears in the deactivation rate sa. The reasoning is the same as for the Hayflick
limit. In fact, as we see in Figure 3d for the model without telomerase, increasing the
parameters rsis not beneficial for the growth of the population (seen in terms of the
number of times the population doubles). Similarly, in this case, it is not beneficial
when the telomerase is active (seen here in terms of the population size growth rate
λ0).
As previously mentioned, we also consider parameter values which yield λ0<0, i.e. a
subcritical population. In particular, in Figure 4, we see that certain values of q0andM
yieldasubcriticalpopulation, despitethepresenceoftelomerase. Inthiscase, theasymptotic
average population size of active cells decays exponentially until extinction, so that the total
population size eventually plateaus out, and thus the Hayflick limit is finite.
To study this in more detail, in Figure 5, we represent the Hayflick limit as a function
of the parameters q0andMfor these values. As expected, the monotonic behaviour is the
same as in Figure 4.

(right picture) and all other parameters being as in (17) and (18).
On the other hand, when λ0is positive, the Hayflick limit is infinite. This is the case,
for example, for the default set of parameters given at the start of the subsection. Figure 6
represents the evolution of certain functions of the distribution of telomere lengths in cells
for this default set of parameters. For convenience, we have plotted the distribution of
the minimum, maximum and mean (in each cell) of the telomere lengths. We observe the
convergence of the distribution toward the distribution ν, as stated in Theorem 4.5.
Finally, in Figure 7, we have plotted these distributions at the final time of the simulation
for different values of K. We see that, the higher the number of chromosomes K, the higher
the variance of the telomere length distribution. In particular, this figure shows that as the
number of chromosomes increases, the average of the distribution of the minimum telomere
length decreases. Since in addition, the deactivation and removal of cells from the system are
determined by the length of the shortest telomeres in the cells, this entails that λ0decreases
withK, as demonstrated by Table 1.

6 Discussion
We built a probabilistic individual based model for the telomere dynamics in a population
of cells. We studied theoretically and numerically the dynamics of this model, with and
without telomerase. In particular, we estimated numerically the effect of several parameters
on the Hayflick limit and the growth of the size of the cell population.
Although the probabilistic model was built to mimic the biological mechanisms involved
in telomere length dynamics, we made several assumptions in order to make the model more
tractable for theoretical and numerical analysis, and in particular, to keep the number of
parameters in the model sufficiently small. However, in some situations, one may wish to
consider the following mechanisms: abrupt telomere shortening [49], single strand breaks
[60] and oxidative stress [59, 2]. This would require one to modify our model to allow ωto
be random and to include rare abrupt events.
Additional mechanisms may also be studied mathematically and numerically. Namely,
one may take into account the reactivation of telomerase in inactive cells (e.g. Telomerase
reverse transcriptase in cancer cells [20]), fluctuation of the telomerase intensity through
time or the population (depending on the environment or on the state of the population,
leadingtoprobabilisticmodelsinrandomenvironmentsorwithdensitydependence)oron/off
commutator mechanisms, typically modelled by a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process
24representing the density of a commutator enzyme (see [55] for a biological description of
commutators). To model logistic constraints, one may also wish to consider a spatial model
(see e.g. [15]) or include the dynamics of a shared limited resource in the model (as e.g. for
chemostat models, see [23]). Finally, one may study the influence of the dependence of the
overhangωon the length of the telomere, empirically observed in [33, 45].
We finally mention the possibility of modelling an age-dependent process. At the expense
of additional technicalities and an increase in model complexity, one may choose to study
an age-dependent model, where the different rates described in our model depend on the
age of the cell, see e.g. [40]. From a probabilistic perspective, this lies in the setting of
Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes [35].
In our numerical simulations, we used parameter values inspired by empirical measures
from the biological literature. Another natural approach, which will be the subject of further
research, is to estimate the parameters from empirical data. Since most experimental data
concerning human cells are available for differentiated cells, such as leukocytes (see e.g. [53]
where the distribution of telomere length in humans is studied), in future work, we will
study population processes to model multi-tissue organisms where stem cells differentiate
into specialized cells.

A Algorithm
Here we present the interacting particle approximation scheme used to produce the simula-
tions in Section 5. The following algorithm allows one to simulate a population with fixed
size,Nsay. Initially, eachparticleevolvesaccordingtoanindependentcopyofa(sub)Markov
process. When a particle is killed, it is resampled from the surviving population and the
particles then continue to evolve independently. In this case, the process evolves according
to(¯Ct,¯Xt)t≥0defined in the proof of Theorem 4.5. We refer the reader to [16, 17] for further
details of algorithms of this type.
Remark A.1.The estimation of λ0from Algorithm 1 by the methods of [16, 17] is valid
under the convergence stated in Theorem 4.5. Despite the fact that Theorem 4.5 was proved
under restrictive assumptions (including λ0>0), numerical simulations suggest that the
convergence also holds true for all the parameters choices of Section 5. Based on these con-
siderations, we allow ourselves to use the same numerical methods to estimate the parameter
λ0across Section 5. In particular, we consider certain parameter regimes where λ0≤0, in
order to illustrate that our result should hold under less restrictive assumptions, and to
provide the reader with a more complete picture. We leave the question of the possible
generalization of Theorem 4.5 to these parameters open.
