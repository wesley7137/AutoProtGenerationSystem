Title: Mathematical Analysis of a Clonal Evolution Model of Tumour Cell
  Proliferation
Abstract:   We investigate a partial differential equation model of a cancer cell
population, which is structured with respect to age and telomere length of
cells. We assume a continuous telomere length structure, which is applicable to
the clonal evolution model of cancer cell growth. This model has a non-standard
non-local boundary condition. We establish global existence of solutions and
study their qualitative behaviour. We study the effect of telomere restoration
on cancer cell dynamics. Our results indicate that without telomere
restoration, the cell population extinguishes. With telomere restoration,
exponential growth occurs in the linear model. We further characterise the
specific growth behaviour of the cell population for special cases. We also
study the effects of crowding induced mortality on the qualitative behaviour,
and the existence and stability of steady states of a nonlinear model
incorporating crowding effect. We present examples and extensive numerical
simulations, which illustrate the rich dynamic behaviour of the linear and
nonlinear models.

1.Introduction
Mathematical models of tumour growth provide insight into the dynamic charac-
teristics of tumour cell populations. Important issues are cell proliferation, cell hetero-
geneity, and cell dierentiation. These issues are currently examined in two hypothesized
models of tumour evolution: the cancer stem cell (CSC) model and the clonal evolution
(CE) model[27, 40]. Both models have scientic support, as well as therapeutic implica-
tions, and in fact, both models may be involved in the development of a tumour. The
essential distinction of the two models is the role of self-renewal in specic cells, and
the fraction of the total cell populations that these cells comprise. Here self-renewal
means the ability of a cell to inherit a specic function through an unlimited number of
successive cell generations.

The CSC model hypothesizes that a very small sub-population of tumour stem cells
generate the entire tumour cell population [43, 49]. In mathematical treatments, these
stem cells have the ability to self-renew indenitely, and through sequential mutations
generate all the heterogeneous and dierentiated cell types comprising the tumour [1, 6,
13, 18, 23, 24, 34, 37, 38, 39, 41, 44, 47, 50, 51, 54]. This stem cell population lies at the
apex of a hierarchical structure of cell types, and tumour evolution is dependent on their
unconstrained self-renewing ability [30].
The CE model hypothesizes that a tumour population is composed of multiple genet-
ically identical clones, which have the possibility of mutation, selection, and expansion
[8, 43, 48]. In the CE model all undierentiated cells have a self-renewing capacity for
contributing to the tumour evolution. These cells, however, are not at the apex of a
hierarchal tree, but rather dispersed widely throughout the tumour cell population as a
large fraction of the total tumour cell count.
A central element of cell self-renewal is the Hayick limit, which constrains dier-
entiated cell lines to a nite number of divisions [28]. As dierentiated cells divide,
telomeres (nucleotide sequences at the ends of chromosomes) shorten until a critical
limit is reached, and further divisions are prohibited [33, 46]. The existence of a mech-
anism which reverses telomere shortening was predicted several decades ago. The CSC
model hypothesizes that cancer stem cells circumvent telomere shortening by using the
enzyme telomerase to replace their telomeres, and thus obtain the ability to divide indef-
initely [43]. Recently, it has been shown that around 90% of all types of human cancer
exhibit a form of telomerase activation [27]. In the CSC model this property resides in
an extremely small sub-population, from which all the dierentiated tumour cells de-
rive. In contrast, the CE model hypothesizes that a large number of undierentiated
cells, in clonal sub-populations, possess the ability to restore telomeres, and thus sustain
the tumour evolution. These two models dier greatly in their fraction of self-renewing
cells within the total population. Mathematical models provide a way to compare these
self-renewal properties in proliferating cell populations.
In order to model the dynamics of self-renewing cells lineages, which correspond phys-
iologically to chromosomal telomere lengths, is it necessary to track all cells through
successive generations. Many mathematical treatments of telomere structure in cell pop-
ulation dynamics have been developed [4, 5, 7, 16, 31]. The CSC model has been treated
for example in [31], where telomere shortening is investigated in continuum dierential
equation models. The key focus of these treatments is that mother stem cells produce
two daughter cells, one of which is a stem cell, and the other, a dierentiated cell, with
a limited number of future divisions. These models describe a nite number of sub-
populations, each with an idealised precise telomere length. The self-renewal property
of a stem cell is captured by one daughter cell remaining in the highest telomere class
and the other daughter cell transiting to a lower telomere class. A descent of telomere
length shortening continues in each class, with one daughter cell retaining the length ofANALYSIS OF A CLONAL EVOLUTION MODEL 3
the mother and the other a lower length. This model yields a minute fraction of stem
cells at the apex of the total population, consistent with the CSC literature [43].
The objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical analysis for the alternative CE
model and to quantify its dynamic properties. Our model here incorporates continuum,
rather than discrete, telomere lengths in cells. This idealised continuum telomere length
is assumed for convenience, to avoid unwieldy compartmentalisation with each telomere
length subclass. In our CE model of telomere shortening there is an unbalanced division
of a mother cell to two daughter cells in terms of telomere length. The telomere length
of a daughter cell may be less (corresponding to a dierentiated cell), or may be equal
or greater (corresponding to a self-renewing cell) than the mother cell. In this way the
restoration of telomeres and the self-renewal property of cells is distributed through a
large proportion of the tumour cell population, consistent with the CE literature[43]. The
distribution of daughter cell telomere lengths is governed by a mathematically formulated
rule that assigns the telomere restoration property to cells which may be viewed as those
capable of indenite divisions in each of the diverse clonal sub-populations.
Our CE model belongs to the class of continuum structured population models, with
age and time as dynamic variables, and telomere length as a population structure vari-
able. In the past three decades physiologically structured population models have been
increasingly utilised to shed light on some important phenomena of cell populations
[4, 5, 15, 16, 29, 31, 36]. The power of structuring a population with respect to phys-
iological variables is of great value in understanding the evolution of biological popula-
tions. There is an increasing literature of physiologically structured population models
with more than one (physiological) structuring variable. The development of a unied
mathematical framework, where structuring variables play substantially dierent roles,
promises to be extremely challenging from the theoretical point of view.
We rst consider the following linear model for an age and telomere length structured
proliferating cancer cell population.

(a;l) quanties the natural mortality of cells of age aand telomere length l. A mother
cell of ageaand telomere length ldivides into two daughter cells of age 0 having (possibly)
dierent telomere lengths, at a rate determined by the function (a;l). The function
r(l;^l) describes the distribution of daughter telomere lengths lfrom a mother cell of
telomere length ^l. The boundary condition (1.2) accounts for cell division of a mother
cell into two daughter cells and requires that
Zlm

0r(l;^l) d^ldl= 1: (1.4)
From a probabilistic interpretation of r(l;^l) it would be natural to normalise the maximal
telomere length lmto 1. Throughout we retain lmas a general parameter. We will impose
further regularity assumptions on the model ingredients later on. Note that our model
(1.1)-(1.3) can be considered as a continuous telomere length structured counterpart of
the model recently introduced in [31].
2.Existence of the governing linear semigroup
Our starting model (1.1)-(1.3) is a linear one, moreover the telomere length lonly
plays an important role in the somewhat unusual boundary condition (1.2). Hence to
establish the existence of the governing linear semigroup (and therefore the existence
of mild solutions of the PDE (1.1)-(1.3)) we use a boundary perturbation result due to
Greiner, see Theorem 2.3 in [26]; see also [25] and [14] for similar general results. It is
very natural to apply the boundary perturbation result of Greiner, since the unperturbed
generator (arising from equation (1.1) with zero ux boundary condition) is readily shown
to generate a translation semigroup. Moreover, it has the added advantage that the
spectrally determined growth behaviour of the semigroup follows almost instantaneously,
see Proposition 3.1 in [26]. For basic denitions and results not introduced in the section
we refer the reader to [3, 19].
To apply the perturbation result of Greiner we set the framework as follows. Assume
that2C1
+([0;am][0;lm]) and;r2L1
+((0;am)(0;lm)), and that all of the model
parameters are non-negative. In particular, it is natural to assume that does not
vanish (ina) identically for any l>0. We also impose the natural assumption that cells
reaching the maximal age do not reproduce anymore, i.e. (am;)0. This assumption
is completely natural from the biological point of view. If cells would still divide upon
reaching the maximum age then it would be natural to extend the age-interval beyond am.
In other words, we have set the maximal age amsuch that cells of this age do not divide
for any more. On the other hand, we will see later when we introduce nonlinearities in
model (1.1)-(1.3), that non-reproducing cells still play a role in the population dynamics,ANALYSIS OF A CLONAL EVOLUTION MODEL 5
in particular they may aect competition induced mortality. Also note that alternatively,
we could have assumed that the mortality is locally integrable with respect to age, butRam
0(a;) da=1holds, i.e. no individuals survive the maximal age am.
For the linear problem (1.1)-(1.3), since we are dealing with density functions, the
natural choice of state space is the following Lebesgue space.

Elements ofXabove can be understood as equivalence classes of measurable functions

setY=L1(0;lm). We dene the operators AandBas follows

L: (D(A);jjjjA)!Y;Lv=v(0;):
ThenLis also continuous and linear, and we have Im( L) =Y. We denote byA0the
restriction ofAto Ker(L). It is then clear that A0generates the strongly continuous

from (ker( A);jjjjA) ontoY, hence its inverse
L:= 

is continuous, for 2(A0). In particular, a straightforward calculation shows that in
our setting we have L:y()!e y(), and therefore for large enough (I L)
is invertible and positive. Hence by Lemma 1.4 in [26] we have that R(;A) is positive
forlarge enough. Since Bis a bounded multiplication operator, we draw the following
conclusion.
Corollary 2.2.A+Bgenerates a positive strongly continuous semigroup of bounded
linear operators on X.ANALYSIS OF A CLONAL EVOLUTION MODEL 7
3.Asymptotic behaviour
In this section we study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the linear model
(1.1)-(1.3). In particular, as we will see, we are going to characterise the spectral bound
of the linear semigroup generator A+Bimplicitly via the spectral radius of an associated
(bounded) integral operator. We will then obtain estimates for the spectral radius of this
integral operator.
As we have pointed out earlier one of the advantages of the perturbation theorem of
Greiner (Theorem 2.1) is that it allows us to establish a desirable regularity property
of the semigroup in a straightforward fashion. To this end, for the rest of the paper we
further assume that rsatises the following regularity condition.

t!0(t) = 0; k2R: (3.14)
Note that, for example if ris continuous on the square [0 ;lm][0;lm], then condition
(3.14) clearly holds. We recall now from [26] the result we are going to apply, for the
readers convenience. In particular, Proposition 3.1 in [26] reads as follows.
Proposition 3.3. IfAgenerates a semigroup and is compact then ess(A0) =
ess(A). In particular, +(A0)\(A)contains only poles of nite algebraic multi-
plicity of the resolvent R(;A).
In the proposition above +(A0) stands for the component of the resolvent set of
A0, which is unbounded to the right. We apply now Proposition 3.3 in our setting. In
what follows, with a slight abuse of notation, we will denote the semigroup generated by
A+BbyT.
Proposition 3.4. Assume that (3.14) holds. Then the spectrum of the governing linear
semigroupTmay contain only elements of the form et, whereis an eigenvalue of its
generatorA+B.
Proof. We note thatBis bounded andA0generates a nilpotent semigroup. Hence,
utilising Proposition 3.3, it is only left to show that  is compact. Let SXdenote the
unit sphere ofX. We have to show that ( SX) is relatively compact in Y=L1(0;lm).
Using the Fr echet-Kolmogorov criterion of compactness of sets in L1[55, Ch.X.1], it is
enough to show that on the one hand we have
jjSXjjY=Zlm
0j(x)(l)jdlCr: (3.15)8 J. Z. FARKAS AND G. F. WEBB

therefore we have
lim
t!0Zlm
0j(x)(l+t) (x)(l)jdl= 0;
uniformly in  x. 
We shall point out that we really needed to utilise Proposition 3.3 by Greiner, to
obtain that the asymptotic behaviour of the semigroup is determined by the leading
eigenvalue of its generator (if it exists). This is due to the distributed structuring with
respect to the telomere length of cells, which implies that the governing semigroup is
not necessarily eventually dierentiable; hence we could not conclude, as for example in
[22] for a classic size-structured models, that the semigroup is eventually compact, and
henceforth the spectral mapping theorem holds true.
As we have seen earlier the semigroup Tgenerated byA+Bis clearly positive, but
it may not necessarily be irreducible. To see this, recall from [19], that the semigroup
generated byA+Bis irreducible if and only if for every f, 06f2X+, we have that
R(;A+B)f0, i.e. the resolvent is strictly positive, for some >s (A+B).

:ANALYSIS OF A CLONAL EVOLUTION MODEL 9
Note that since telomere length is preserved during the lifetime of an individual, it is
intuitively clear that the semigroup is irreducible if ospring of all telomere length is
produced by some individuals. In other words, if there were individuals of particular
telomere lengths who would not produce individuals of any other lengths, then the semi-
group would be reducible. We formulate now a rigorous condition for the irreducibility
of the semigroup, as this will play an important role later in the qualitative analysis of
model (1.1)-(1.3).
Proposition 3.5. The semigroupTgenerated byA+Bis irreducible if and only if
for any set I[0;lm]of positive Lebesgue measure, such that its complement set Iis
also a set of positive Lebesgue measure, we have
Z
IZ
Ir(l;^l) d^ldl6= 0: (3.18)
Proof. Note that by virtue of the positivity of the semigroup generated by A+B, the
resolvent operator R(;A+B) is positive, for large enough. Hence the solution u(0;)
of equation (3.17) is necessarily non-negative almost everywhere. Assume now that (3.18)
does not hold, i.e.R
IR
Ir(l;^l) d^ldl= 0 for some sets I;Iof positive measure. Then it
is clear that for any fvanishing on I, equation (3.17) would admit a solution u(0;)
vanishing on I, too; and therefore ugiven by (3.16) would also vanish on I. On the other
hand, if there was a function u60 vanishing on a set J[0;lm] of positive measure for
almost every a2(0;am), then equation (3.16) would imply that the solution u(0;) of
(3.17) would also vanish on J, but then this would clearly implyR
JR
Jr(l;^l) d^ldl= 0, a
contradiction. 
Proposition 3.4 implies that the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of model (1.1)-(1.3)
is determined by the eigenvalues of the generator (if there are any), hence we study this
eigenvalue problem now. In particular, the solution of the eigenvalue problem
(A+B) = ;  (0) =  ; (3.19)
is given by
 (a;l) = (0;l) exp
 Za
0((^a;l) +(^a;l) +) d^a

Applying the boundary operator  on both sides of the equation above we have
 (0;l) = 2Zlm
0r(l;^l) (0;^l)K(^l;) d^l; (3.21)

0(a;) exp
 Za
0((^a;) +(^a;) +) d^a
da: (3.22)
Hence2Cis an eigenvalue of A+Bif and only if, for the given , the integral
equation (3.21) has a non-trivial solution  (0;). Then, the eigenvector corresponding10 J. Z. FARKAS AND G. F. WEBB
tois given by (3.20). We are in particular interested in the leading eigenvalue (if it
exists), which is the spectral bound of the generator, since the semigroup Tis positive.
This dominant real eigenvalue, together with the corresponding eigenspace, determines
the asymptotic behaviour of solutions. Also note that equation (3.21) gives naturally
rise to dene a parametrised family of (positive and bounded) integral operators Oas
Ox= 2Zlm
0r(;^l)K(^l;)x(^l) d^l; D (O) =L1(0;lm); 2R: (3.23)
With this, the characteristic equation (3.21), which is notably a functional equation, in
contrast to a scalar equation in case of a model with age-structure only; can be viewed
as an eigenvalue problem for a bounded linear integral operator. More precisely, is an
eigenvalue of the generator A+B, if and only the integral operator Ohas eigenvalue
1. Note that, since Kdened in (3.22) is strictly positive, the integral operator O
(for every2R) is irreducible if and only if condition (3.18) holds [45, Ch.V]. Hence,
rightly so, the irreducibility conditions of the semigroup Tand the integral operator O
coincide.
Also note that the function [0 ;1)3!r(O) is continuous and strictly monotone
decreasing. These properties can be established by using perturbation results from [2]
and [32], respectively; see also [9, 11] for similar developments. Also note that if r
satises condition (3.14) then O0is shown to be compact exactly in the same way as the
operator  was shown to be compact earlier. Hence the spectrum of O0may contain
only eigenvalues and 0.
Therefore, in the case when the spectrum of A+Bis not empty, we have the following
complete characterisation of the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of model (1.1)-(1.3).
(1) Ifr(O0)<1, then solutions of model (1.1)-(1.3) decay exponentially.
(2) Ifr(O0)>1, then solutions of model (1.1)-(1.3) grow exponentially. Moreover,
ifrsatises condition (3.18), then solutions exhibit asynchronous exponential
growth.
(3) Ifr(O0) = 1, then for any eigenvector  (0;) corresponding to the spectral radius
1 ofO0, the function  in (3.20) determines a one-parameter family of positive
steady states of model (1.1)-(1.3). If rsatises (3.18), then there is only one such
family of steady states, moreover they are strictly positive, too.
After the previous general analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of our model next
we intend to study the eect of the well-known capacity of telomere restoring of cancer
cells on the dynamics. In particular we are going to show, that at least for some general
classes of the model ingredients, the telomere length restoring capacity of cancer cells
may have a drastic eect on the asymptotic behaviour of solutions already in the linear
model (1.1)-(1.3). First we note that in the absence of telomere restoring capacity of cells,
the function rnecessarily vanishes on the half square ^ll. That is, when a mother cell
divides, it only gives birth to daughter cells with shorter telomeres. This is a well-known
mechanism observed in healthy cell populations. In particular this telomere shorteningANALYSIS OF A CLONAL EVOLUTION MODEL 11
of healthy cells results in apoptosis (when reaching the celebrated Hayick limit) and
prevent the possibility of drastic mutations caused by a very large number of iterations
of faulty DNA replication. In this case the boundary condition (1.2) can be rewritten as
p(0;l;t) = 2Zlm
lr(l;^l)Zam
0(a;^l)p(a;^l) dad^l;0<llm; t> 0: (3.24)
This in particular implies that the eigenvalue problem (3.21) now reads
	(l) = 2Zlm
lr(l;^l)	(^l)K(^l;) d^l; (3.25)
where we also introduced the notation 	( l) := (0;l), for simplicity. Let us assume now
that the the function ris separable, i.e. r(l;^l) =r1(l)r2(^l) holds for some functions r1;r2.
For example we may assume that r1is continuously dierentiable and r2is bounded, and
thatr1is positive while r2is non-negative. Then assumption (3.14) clearly holds. In
this case dierentiating equation (3.25) (assuming that an eigenvector  with a smooth
	 component exists) yields the dierential equation
	0(l) = 	(l)r0
1(l)
r1(l) 2r1(l)r2(l)K(l;)
; (3.26)
together with the initial condition
	(0) = 2r1(0)Zlm
0r2(^l)K(^l;)	(^l) d^l: (3.27)
The solution of (3.26) is
	(l) = 	(0)r1(l)
r1(0)exp(
 Zl
02r1(^l)r2(^l)K(^l;) d^l)
; (3.28)
which, utilising (3.27), leads to the following characteristic equation
1 = 2Zlm
0r1(l)r2(l)K(l;) exp(
 2Zl
0r1(^l)r2(^l)K(^l;) d^l)
dl
= 1 exp(
 2Zlm
0r1(l)r2(l)K(^l;) d^l)
: (3.29)
It is clear that equation (3.29) does not admit any solution 2R, which, together with
the positivity of the semigroup, implies that the spectrum of A+Bdoes not contain any
eigenvalue with a corresponding eigenvector  with a continuously dierentiable  (0;l).
On the other hand it is clear from equation (3.25) that any eigenvector is continuous
with respect to its second variable. From the biological point of view this phenomenon
is associated with the constant loss of telomere length of newborn cells. Indeed, in the
absence of telomere restoring capacity we may expect that the cell population accumu-
lates at the minimal length. From the mathematical point of view, the non-existence12 J. Z. FARKAS AND G. F. WEBB
of dierentiable eigenvectors is associated with the fact that the governing semigroup
cannot shown to be eventually dierentiable due to the telomere length structuring.
Next we consider what happens if we account for the telomere restoring capacity of
cancer cells. In particular we are going to show that in this case even exponential growth
of the cancer cell population is possible. As before, we start with the case of a separable
r, i.e. we assume that r(l;^l) =r1(l)r2(^l) for some functions r1;r2. In this case the
integral operator O0is of rank one, and it is rather straightforward to exactly determine
the spectral radius of O0, which, as we have seen earlier, determines the asymptotic
behaviour of the semigroup T. In particular, we have
r(O0) =2Zlm
0r1(l)r2(l)K(l;0) dl

dadl:(3.30)
From (3.30) we can see that depending on the functions r1;r2;and, the spectral
radiusr(O0) may be greater than 1. For example in the case of constant functions
r1;r2;; , and setting lm=am= 1 (note that we can always normalise the maximal
age and telomere length), we have
r(O0) = 2r1r21 e (+)
+:
To obtain estimates for the spectral radius of O0in the more general and dicult
non-separable case, note that the Krein-Rutman theorem asserts that if O0is compact
and positive, and its spectral radius is positive, then it has a positive (not necessarily
strictly positive) eigenvector corresponding to its spectral radius. On the other hand de
Pagter proved in [12] that if the operator is also irreducible then its spectral radius is
strictly positive. As we noted earlier if rsatises condition (3.14) then O0is shown to be
compact in the same way as the operator . Assuming now that the spectral radius is
positive, let u2L1
+(0;lm) denote the positive eigenvector corresponding to the spectral
radius. Then we have
2Zlm
0r(;^l)K(^l;0)u(^l) d^l=r(O0)u(); (3.31)
which yields
2Zlm
0u(^l)K(^l;0)Zlm
0r(l;^l) dld^l=r(O0)Zlm

This observation allows us to obtain immediately the following estimates for the spectral

To obtain dierent estimates, in particular when O0may not be irreducible we are going
to utilise some minimax principles established in [35]. Recall that if Xis a Banach lattice
with positive cone K, and with dual space Xand dual cone K, respectively; then a
setH0Kis calledK-total if and only if from hx;x0i0;8x02H0it follows that
x2K. Then for any positive linear endomorphism Oon a Banach lattice Xand for any
x2Kone denes
rx(O) = sup
f2Rj(Ox x)2Kg:
Recall that by Lemma 3.1 in [35] for any K-total setH0Kwe have
rx(O) = sup
f2RjhOx;x0ihx;x0i; x02H0g: (3.34)
Moreover, Lemma 3.3 in [35] asserts that for any 0 6x2Kwe haverx(O)r(O). If
we letx1, then we have for any x02K
hO01;x0i2 min

0x0(l) dl
= 2 min
lZlm
0r(l;^l)K(^l;0) d^lh1;x0i: (3.35)
Similarly, recall from [35] that if we dene
rx(O) = inf
f2Rjhx;x0ihOx;x0i; x02H0g; (3.36)
then for every x2Kwe haver(O)rx(O). Again, choosing x1, we have for any
x02K

0r(l;^l)K(^l;0) d^lZlm
0x0(l) dl

0r(l;^l)K(^l;0) d^lh1;x0i: (3.37)
Hence we obtain the following estimates for the spectral radius of O0
2 min

0r(l;^l)K(^l;0) d^lr(O0)2 max
lZlm
0r(l;^l)K(^l;0) d^l: (3.38)
Note that the estimates (3.33) and (3.38) are quite dierent, in general.
We next provide hypotheses on r(l;^l) that yield specic growth behavior of the solu-
tions in the presence or absence of highest telomere class renewal. It is known that in the
discrete telomere length case, the cell population can have polynomial growth or decay
with cells with shortest telomere length having the highest power growth over time (see
e.g. [4],[5],[16]). Similar results hold in the continuum telomere length case if we divide
the population into telomere length classes. We rst consider the case of no self-renewal
within any class, that is, all cell divisions result in daughter cells in a shorter telomere
length class.14 J. Z. FARKAS AND G. F. WEBB

We next provide sucient conditions for a class of cells of longest telomeres to have
sucient self-renewal capacity for them to attain proliferative immortality. We assume
that the division rate (a;l) and mortality rate (a;l) are constant in this class, and the
fraction of dividing cells in this class with self-renewal is suciently large to overcome
the loss of cells due to division and mortality.16 J. Z. FARKAS AND G. F. WEBB

Remark 3.8 We note that a similar result can be established for other classes of
cells with self-renewal capability, of telomere length in a specic -interval. Such cell
populations can arise from a single mutant cell, which generates more daughter cells
with this mutation than competitor cells, and thus expand in a clone within the tumor
cell population.ANALYSIS OF A CLONAL EVOLUTION MODEL 19
4.Incorporating crowding effect
Next we introduce a nonlinearity in model (1.1)-(1.3) by incorporating crowding/competition
eects via imposing extra mortality pressure on cells. We follow the same approach as
employed previously in [5, 16, 17, 52] for similar cell population models. Our equations
now read
@p
@t(a;l;t )+@p
@a(a;l;t ) = ((a;l) +(a;l))p(a;l;t ) F(P(t))p(a;l;t ); (4.56)

In equation (4.56) Fis a non-negative function, and it also satises some smoothness
assumptions. For example it suces to assume that Fis continuously dierentiable.
Equation (4.56) is still semilinear, hence global existence of solutions can be established
at least ifFis Lipschitz continuous via integrating along characteristics and using a
contraction mapping principle, see for example [11, 53], where this approach was in fact
applied to establish global existence of solutions of a similar model. In the simplest
case, when Fis a linear function, our model (4.56)-(4.58) ts into the exact framework
studied in [17], if some additional hypotheses are fullled. In particular, if we assume
that there exists a 02Rand a bounded linear operator P0(a projection onto the
nite-dimensional eigenspace corresponding to the spectral bound of A+B), such that
lim
t!1e 0tT(t)x=P0xandF(F0(P0(x)))>0 holds; then the nonlinear semigroup
governing (4.56)-(4.58) is given explicitly as
S(t)x=T(t)x
1 +Rt
0F(F0(T(s)x)) ds: (4.59)
In the formulas above we introduced the notation F0for the bounded linear integral
operatorF0u=Rlm
0Ram
0u(a;l) dadl, with domain D(F0) =X.
Note that some asymptotic results for more general classes of nonlinearities were al-
ready obtained in the earlier paper [52]. In particular for a continuous, non-negative and
monotone increasing function Fit was proven, under the same assumptions as above, that
0<0 implies that solutions corresponding to initial conditions x02X+\D(A+B),
such thatP0x02X+n0 holds, tend to 0. On the other hand, if 00, then solutions
corresponding to initial conditions as above, tend toF 1(0)P0x0
F0(P0x0).
Here we are mainly interested how the asymptotic behaviour of the nonlinear model
changes compared to the linear model (1.1)-(1.3), for a general nonlinear function F. In
particular, we are interested if the linear model with exponential growth (accounting for
the telomere restoring capacity of cancer cells) can be stabilised by adding competition
eects, i.e. by incorporating competition induced nonlinearity. Here, under stabilisation,20 J. Z. FARKAS AND G. F. WEBB
we mean that the addition of the nonlinear mortality term into a linear model whose
solutions grow exponentially, leads to a model with a (unique) asymptotically stable
positive steady state.
The existence and uniqueness of the positive steady state of the nonlinear model
(4.56)-(4.58) is established using the techniques we developed in the previous section to
study the asymptotic behaviour of the linear model. In particular solving equation (4.56)
for a positive steady state we obtain

we established in the previous section about the spectral radius of the operator O, we
summarize our nding in the following proposition.
Proposition 4.9. Assume that rsatises condition (3.18) . Then, ifFis a monotone
increasing function, and either of the following conditions holds

hand, ifFis a monotone decreasing function, then either of the following conditions

implies that the nonlinear model (4.56) -(4.58) has a unique strictly positive steady state.
Note that if Fis not monotone, for example if the competition induced mortality
exhibits an All ee-type eect, then we can still establish the existence of the positive
steady state by using the estimates (3.33)-(3.38) for the spectral radius, but we may
loose uniqueness in general, and the dynamic behaviour will certainly be more complex.
Next we investigate the stability of the steady states of the nonlinear model (4.56)-
(4.58). Note that our model is a semilinear one (moreover the nonlinear operator is
dierentiable), hence stability can be studied indeed via linearisation, see e.g. [42, 53].
To this end note that the linearisation of equation (4.56) around a steady state preads
@u
@t(a;l;t )+@u
@a(a;l;t ) = ((a;l)+(a;l)+F(P))u(a;l;t ) F0(P)p(a;l)U(t);(4.64)
where we set U(t) =Rlm
0Ram
0u(a;l;t ) dadl. The linearised model (4.64)-(4.57)-(4.58) is
also governed by a strongly continuous semigroup, since equation (4.64) is just a bounded
perturbation (at least when FisC1) of the linear equation (1.1). Moreover, the growth
bound of the semigroup is also determined by the spectral bound of its generator. Also
note that if F0(P)<0, for example if Fis monotone decreasing, then the semigroup
governing the linearised problem (4.64)-(4.57)-(4.58) is positive, too. On the other hand,
ifF0(P)>0, then the governing semigroup cannot shown to be positive, and stability
might be lost via Hopf-bifurcation. The linearised equation (4.64) leads the following
eigenvalue problem
 u0 (++F(P))u F0(P)pU=u; u (0) = (u); (4.65)
where we set U=Rlm

Hence2Cis an eigenvalue of the linearised operator, if and only if the inhomogeneous
integral equation (4.67) has a non-trivial solution u(0;). As we can see the information
pertainingis rather implicit. However, in case of the extinction steady state p0,
equation (4.67) reduces to an integral equation of the form of (3.21), and therefore the
stability of the extinction steady state is established using the techniques we developed
in the previous section. Also note that in this case the governing linear semigroup is
positive. In particular, we have the following result.
Proposition 4.10. Either of the conditions in (4.63) imply that the extinction steady
statep0is asymptotically stable. On the other hand, either of the conditions in
(4.62) imply that the steady state p0is unstable.
Remark 4.11 Note the connection between the existence of a non-trivial steady state
and the stability of the trivial one. In particular, for a monotone increasing F, either
of conditions in (4.62) implies that a unique strictly positive steady state exists and
the trivial one is unstable. On the other hand, if Fis monotone decreasing, either
of conditions in (4.63) implies that a unique strictly positive steady state exists and
the trivial steady state is locally asymptotically stable. Moreover, in this case, since the
governing linear semigroup is positive, we may anticipate that the unique strictly positive
steady state is unstable. In fact we are going to prove this later on.
Next we study the stability of the positive steady state. First we note that in the
special but interesting case, when F0(P) = 0, the eigenvalue problem (4.67) (now a
homogeneous integral equation) simply reads
u(0;l) =2Zlm
0r(l;^l)u(0;^l)Zam
0(a;^l)(a;^l;) dad^l: (4.68)
That is, the eigenvalue problem (4.68) above can be written as
O(+F(P))x= 1x; 2C; x60;
whereOis dened earlier in (3.23). Note that, since the semigroup governing the lin-
earised equation is positive, the spectral bound belongs to its spectrum, i.e. it is a
dominant real eigenvalue, which determines the asymptotic behaviour. Also note that,
the existence of the positive steady state p, with total population size P, requires that
OF(P)x= 1x, with a corresponding positive eigenvector x. In the case when rsatises
(3.18), i.e. the governing linearised semigroup is irreducible, the spectral radius of OF(P)
is the only eigenvalue with a corresponding positive (and strictly positive) eigenvector.
It is also shown, utilising Proposition A.2 from [2] that the function !r(O(+F(P)))
is strictly monotone decreasing, for 2[0;1). Hence we conclude that r(OF(P)) = 1,
and therefore 0 is the dominant eigenvalue of the linearised operator. In this case the
governing linear semigroup is strongly stable, but not uniformly exponentially stable, see
e.g. [19, Ch.V].
Next we consider the general case. We already noted that the information about
the spectral values contained in (4.67) is rather implicit. Moreover, we note that aANALYSIS OF A CLONAL EVOLUTION MODEL 23
biologically relevant and meaningful function Fwould be of a logistic type, i.e. F(0) = 0
andF(strictly) monotone increasing. In this case, as we noted before, the governing
linear semigroup is not positive, hence we cannot guarantee the existence of a dominant
real eigenvalue of the generator, i.e. a dominant real solution of (4.67). Hence we
use a direct approach to establish stability. This approach was employed previously
for some simpler structured population models in [20, 21]. The main advantage of this
approach is that it does not rely on the positivity of the governing linear semigroup.
We now introduce a notation for the generator of the semigroup governing the linearised
problem. Let
Cu= @u

stable if

0r(^l;) d^l (4.69)
holds.
Proof. Our goal is to show that there exists a  > 0 such that the operator C+I
is dissipative (Istands for the identity). That is, we need to show that there exists a
>0, such that we have
jj(I (C+))wjjjjwjj;8>0; w2D(C):
Then, invoking the Lumer-Phillips Theorem [19, II.3], we obtain that the semigroup
generated byCsatisesjjSjje t, fort0, i.e. it is exponentially stable. To this
end, assume that for a given f2X and2R;x2D(C) satises the equation
(I (C+))x=f: (4.70)
Then we are going to show that if condition (4.69) holds, then in fact there exists a >0
small enough, such that jjxjjjjfjjholds, for all >0. The main idea, as in [20, 21], is
to divide the interval (0 ;am) into a countable union of subintervals, now for any xed l;
on each of which the function x(;l) is either positive or negative. That is we write
(0;am) =[
i(ai;bi) =8
<
:[
^i(a^i;b^i)9
=
;[([
i(ai;bi))

such thatx(;l) is positive almost everywhere on each subinterval ( a^i;b^i), and negative
almost everywhere on ( ai;bi), respectively; and vanishes at each end point except when
ai= 0 andbi=am. Over each of the subintervals we multiply equation (4.70) by sgn ax,24 J. Z. FARKAS AND G. F. WEBB

Hence if condition (4.69) holds we can indeed choose a >0 such that the solution xof
(4.70) satisesjjxjjjjfjj, for all>0.
To verify that the range condition holds true (see [19, II.3]), note that for any f2X,
the solution of the equation  Au=f uis

Since  is bounded, it follows from the smoothness assumptions we imposed on andr
(in particular their boundedness), that for any f2X and>0 large enough, the right
hand side of (4.74) belongs to L1(0;lm). Therefore, ugiven by (4.73) clearly satises
u2D(A), and sinceCis a bounded perturbation of A, the range condition holds
true, and the proof is completed. 
Remark 4.13 Note that at the extinction steady state the stability condition (4.69)
reads
(a;l) +(a;l) +F(0)2(a;l)Zlm
0r(^l;l) d^l; a2[0;am]; l2[0:lm]; (4.75)
This is a biologically relevant and natural condition, as it simply says that if mortality
and cell division together is higher than recruitment of new cells into the population,ANALYSIS OF A CLONAL EVOLUTION MODEL 25
then the population dies out. Note the connection between (4.75) and (3.46), which
demonstrates the dichotomy between the stability of the trivial steady state and the
exponential growth of a class of cells with longest telomere length.
Finally, we establish an instability result, for the case when the semigroup governing
the linearised equation is positive and irreducible.
Proposition 4.14. Assume that condition (3.18) holds. Then F0(P)<0implies that
the positive steady state pis unstable.
Proof. We dene the operators C0

D(C0

Note that if (3.18) holds, then C0
generates a positive irreducible semigroup; moreover,
its spectrum is determined by the eigenvalues of its generator C0
, which are of nite
algebraic multiplicity. Also note that the existence of a (strictly) positive steady state
pis characterised by r(QP) = 1, which is equivalent to s(C0
) = 0. SinceGis positive
and bounded, applying Proposition A.2 from [2], we obtain that
0 =s(C0
)<s(C0
+G); (4.76)
hence the steady state pis unstable. 
5.Examples and simulation results
We present three examples to illustrate the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the
CE model. The rst example, which is linear, assumes no self-renewal (i.e. telomere
restoring capacity) of any cell, and shows an extinction of the cell population. The
second example, also linear, allows self-renewal of a large fraction of cells, and shows
exponential growth of the cell population. The third example is a nonlinear version of
the second example, and shows population growth with stabilization of the total cell
count and the age and telomere length structure. In all of the three examples the age
and telomere variables are scaled with am= 6 andlm= 1. In all three examples the
initial population density is
p(a;l;0) = 1000lmaxfa(1 a);0g;
(Figure 2). In all three examples the division modulus 2C1(0;am) is

divide. Note that (a;l)>0 fora > 1, so(a;l) does not vanish in aidentically for26 J. Z. FARKAS AND G. F. WEBB

where0= 0:05 in Example 1, and 0= 0:3 in Examples 2 and 3.
Example 1. No restoration of telomeres occurs in Example 1. The rule governing
the telomere length of a daughter cell of length lfrom a mother cell with length ^lis

whereGis a Gaussian distribution in lwith mean ^l 0:2 and standard deviation 0 :05,
and 0:8 is a normalization factor (Figure 3). Note that r(l;^l) satises (3.18). The
interpretation of this rule is that all daughter cells have telomere length strictly less than
their mother cells. The estimates for the spectral radius r(O0) in (3.33) and (3.38) are
graphed in Figure 4. The upper estimates are less than 1 in both, which means the
total population of cells extinguishes. The simulation of the linear model (1.1)-(1.3) for
Example 1 is given in Figure 5 and Figure 6.
Figure 2. In the left panel the initial age and telomere length distribu-
tionp(a;l;0) of the cell population in all three examples is plotted. In
the right panel the age and telomere length dependent division modulus

Example 2. In this example restoration of telomeres occurs in cells with larger
telomere lengths. The rule governing the telomere length of a daughter cell of length l
from a mother cell with length ^lis
r(l;^l) =G(l;m(^l);0:05)
0:5;
whereGis a Gaussian distribution in lwith mean m(^l) = 1 + 2( ^l 0:9) and standard
deviation 0 :05; and 0:5 is a normalization factor (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Note that
r(l;^l) satises (3.18). The interpretation of this rule is that some daughter cells have
telomere length equal or greater than their mother cells, when the mother cells have longer
lengths. The simulation of this telomere restoration rule for the linear model (1.1)-(1.3)
in Example 2 is given in Figure 9. The total population P2(t) of cells stabilizes in the age
and telomere variables, but the total population size grows exponentially (Figure 10). A
large fraction of cells have longer telomere lengths as the age-telomere length distribution
stabilizes.
Example 3. Example 3 is the nonlinear version (4.56)-(4.58) of Example 2, with the
same parameters. Additionally, the crowding term Fin Example 3 is dened as
F(P) =P;
with= 0:00001. The population stabilizes both in structuring variables aandl(see
Figure 11), as well as in time (Figure 12). The self-renewal properties of the longest
telomere length cells in Example 3, combined with the nonlinear crowding eect, result
in convergence to equilibrium . As in Example 2, a large fraction of total cells have longer
telomere lengths at the stable steady state.

6.Discussion
In this work we have developed a mathematical formulation of cancer cell self-renewal
for the clonal evolution model of tumour growth based on telomere restoration. The
model allows for a continuum of telomere lengths, and thus contrasts to mathemati-
cal treatments of the cancer stem cell model, which incorporate many discrete telomere
length classes [31]. The cancer stem cell model formulates a hierarchal array of length
classes with self-renewing cells in one longest telomere class. The clonal evolution model
allows multiple classes of telomere length cells to have self-renewal capacity, correspond-
ing to clonal structuring.
Our model is thus more tractable for analysis and simulations, which we have provided
here. In particular, in this work we focused on the eect of telomere restoring capacity
of cancer cells. In particular we showed that the asymptotic behaviour of the linear
model is determined by the spectral radius of an integral operator. We then obtained
estimates for the spectral radius of this integral operator. In Section 4 we extended our
model by incorporating a competition induced nonlinearity in the mortality of cells. We
treated the existence and stability of steady states of the the nonlinear model by using
some well-known results from the theory of positive operators. Finally, in Section 5,
we presented a number of examples and the results of numerical simulations, both for
the linear and nonlinear model. The simulations highlight the dynamic behaviour of the
model and underpin the analytical results obtained.
Naturally, many issues remain in the mathematical investigation of the clonal evolution
model of tumour growth. Important questions which can be addressed in the framework
of a mathematical model include the following.
How do sequential mutations enter into the model formulation?
How can quiescent cells be incorporated into the model?
How can spatial heterogeneity be formulated in the equations?
How can more complex nonlinearities be incorporated?
How can the model be implemented with actual experimental data?
These issues and the development of a general mathematical framework for analysing
physiologically structured models with additional distributed structuring variables re-
main important subjects forf further research.
