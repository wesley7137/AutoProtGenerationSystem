Abstract:   Cryopreservation is the only fully established procedure to extend the
lifespan of living cells and tissues, a key to activities spanning from
fundamental biology to clinical practice. Despite its prevalence and impact,
central aspects of cryopreservation, such as the cell's physico-chemical
environment during freezing, remain elusive. Here we address that question by
coupling in situ microscopic directional freezing to visualize cells and their
surroundings during freezing with the freezing medium phase diagram. We extract
the freezing medium spatial distribution in cryopreservation, providing a tool
to describe the cell vicinity at any point during freezing. We show that two
major events define the cells' local environment over time: the interaction
with the moving ice front and with the vitreous moving front - a term we
introduce here. Our correlative strategy may be applied to cells relevant in

 Intro duction  
For decades, cryopreservation has been the pivotal  strategy in preserving  functional living 
matter for extended periods of time. The capacity  to overcome the lifespan of  individual cells, cell 
assemblies or tissues has enabled much of the recent advances in fundamental cell  biology,  cell therapies 
and tissue engineering .1 This ability has been key for several clinical breakthroughs in r eproductive 
biology2, and more generally all cases where the use of immortalized cell lines is not suitable . 
Cryopreservat ion is generally attained  via two – seemingly opposite – approaches whose common 
purpose is to prevent the deleterious effects , direct or not,  of water solidification on cells : vitrification  
and slow freezing  methods.1 Vitrification  consists in  a liquid -solid transition of wat er – intra- and 
extrac ellular – to an amorphous (vitr eous) state  by rapidly cooling (up to 106 °C.min−1)3 below  the glass 
transition temperature4, preventing ice crystallization and thus minimizing cryoinjury. Conversely, slow 
freezing  methods, that involve  programmed temperature decrea se, are nowadays widely  applied  for 
cryopreservation of cells and tissues5,6. Beyond the ir technical diff erences, both vitrification  and slow 
freezing  strategies  rely on an entangled set of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters  that blur the 
analysis of the freezing phenomena . In addition, their respective success is determined by the viability 
and/or vitality  of cells and tissues that are frozen  in presence of permeating cryoprotectant agents 
(pCPA s) such as DMSO which may impo se cytotoxic response by cells .7–10 The challenges in 
establishin g causal effects between the physico -chemical freezing parameters  and the biological 
response s have  diverted the main research efforts towards a different direction, i.e. formula ting new 
freezing media that maximizes cell viability to the stress es imposed by freezing and thawing .  
Strategies to inhibit or minimize  ice crystals formation  while reducing  the harmful effects of 
most pCPAs (e.g. DMSO, glycerol) were proposed by  lowering the later concentrations in presence of 
non-permeating cryoprotectant agents  (npCPAs).11 Also s ucrose and trehalose  were found to accelerate  
dehydration  of cells by altering intra - and extracellular osmotic pressures, which to some extent reduces 
the possibility of intracellular ice gro wth.12,13 Recently, a ntifreeze proteins (AFPs) that present  ice 
recrystallization inhibition (IRI) properties  have been applied as freezing media14, but immunological 
and toxicological issues are still concerns for their clinical use15,16. To circumvent these issues AFP 3 
 mimics  such as Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) have been used for animal  cell17 and bacteria15 
cryopreservation  as biocompatible alternatives  endued with IRI properties. Complex carbo hydrates  such 
as hydroxyethyl starch  (HES)18,19, alginate20–22 or synthetic polyampholytes23 have been adopted in the 
field of cell cryopreservation either with other pC PAs or alone.  More radical solutions have also been 
proposed such as the use of metal -organic frameworks ,24 armors  around cells to prevent damage by ice 
crystals or hydroxyapatite nanoparticles ,13 as vehicles to promote the internalization of CPAs. In most 
of the preceding cases , may they be classical solutions such as  DMSO or more sophisticated solutions 
such as AFPs, one crucial question remains open. What is the local composition of the vi cinity of cells 
during freezing?  
Here we address  that question by using a very simple fre ezing medium, sodium alginate solution 
in water, to focus on the cellular environment during the freezing process. W e adapt ed the directional 
freezing method  developed by Dedovets et al .25 to investigate the interaction between suspended S. 
cerevisiae  cells and a moving freezing front in presence of a polysaccharide salt solution . These 
observations are combined with the analysi s of the water -sodium alginate phase diagram obtained by 
Differential Scanning Calorimetry  (DSC) to draw a more co mplete picture of the freezing environment  
experienced by  S. cerevisiae  cells throughout the freezing process . Directional freezing ha s been 
previously applied to observe red blood cells during freezing26 and to preserve adherent  cells27 as well 
as ovarian28, liver29 and heart30 tissue in complex pCPA -conta ining media . In this work  directional 
freezing provides a controlled freezing environment with clearly defined thermal boundary conditions, 
steady freezing rate, and the ability  to investigate  in situ  the interaction between cells and the freezing 
front. T hese conditions enable to bridge the kinetic and thermodynamic events occurring during 
freezing , to reach  a more complete view of S. cerevisiae  environment prior, during and after interaction 
with the freezing front. Moreover, we demonstrate that despite t he slow freezing approach and the 
absence of pCPAs, the effective segregation between pure ice crystals, and an increasingly concentrated 
phase , rich in cells and alginate , leads to a cellular local environment characterized by a vitreous 
behavior whose pr edominance correlates positively with yeast viability.    4 
 Thermodynamics of freezing media  
Almost all  compounds soluble in water are practically insoluble in hexagonal ice (I h). This 
implies that m ost solutes  are segregated from ice crystals during water f reezing.31,32 Under specific 
conditions , also particles33 and even cells20,26,34 in suspension segregate  towards the interstitial space 
defined b y the new ly formed ice crystals . In the following we estimate cells to stay in the interstitial 
space, and verify this assumption experimentally. The consequence of such segregation step is ce ntral 
in cryobiology since it determines the local composition of the cellular environment during freezing , an 
information that was experimentally unavailable and conceptually overlooked .  
Figure 1.a illustrates the path of an individual cell (in cyan) at two key moments that are defined 
by the solute concentration changes. To characterize the increasingly concentrated media generated 
during ice growth a binary phase diagram of sodium alginate in water was established using DSC  (Figure 
1.b). The freezing te mperature 𝑇𝑓 was determined at the onset of the exothermic crystallization peak for 
polymer volume fractions, 𝜙𝑝 ranging from 0.025 to 0.65 in consecutive freezing and heating cycle at 
10 °C.min-1 (Figure S1). According to Flory ’s theory, t he freezing point  of a polymer solution with high 
polymerization degree ( 𝑁>>>1) can be described by equation 1 ,35   
𝑇𝑓=1+𝑤

Δ𝐻(ln(1−𝜙𝑝)+𝜙𝑝)                                                                   (eq.1) 
where  𝑤 is the regular solution interaction parameter  in 𝐽.𝑚𝑜𝑙−1, ∆𝐻 is the water melting enthalpy 
(∆𝐻=6007  𝐽.𝑚𝑜𝑙−1), 𝜙𝑝 is the polymer volume fraction  and  𝑅 is the Boltzman constant in 𝐽.𝐾−1. 
For 𝜙>0.54 no exothermic peak correspond ing to water freezing was detected at  -10 °C.min-1, 
suggesting that for high polymer content composit ions no ice  crystallization occurred within the 
detection limit of the DSC. The lack of detectable freezing event s is in good agreement with the glass 
transition temperatures calculated for the ice -alginate system defined by Gordon -Taylor  equation35 (eq. 
2),

 where  𝑇𝑔 corresponds to the glass transition temperature for a given composition, 𝑇𝑔𝑤=−137 .15 °𝐶 is 
the pure ice glas s transition tem perature, 𝑇𝑔𝑝=120° 𝐶 is the polymer glass transition temperature and 
𝑘 is an empirical parameter fixed to 0.5  as discussed elsewhere for other polysaccharide systems35. The 
full phase diagram of the alginate/ water binary system is depicted in Figure 1.b. As reported for similar 
polysaccharide systems35, upon cooling at 10 °C.min-1, sodium alginate solutions ( L) below  𝜙<0.54 
tend to segregate into a pure ice phase ( I) along with an increasingly  concentrated solution phase ( L). If 
the mixture is cooled below the temperature defined by the intersection between 𝑇𝑓 and 𝑇𝑔 then a 
vitreous ( V) or glassy phase is fo rmed whose composition is defined by the same intersection between 
𝑇𝑓 and 𝑇𝑔.  
From another set of DSC experiment s we quantified the ice volume fraction 𝜙𝑖𝑐𝑒 from the 
integral of the ice melting enthalpy in alginate -water binary mixtures. From the values of 𝜙𝑖𝑐𝑒 obtained, 
we determined the  volume fraction of non -frozen water associated with the polymer for each alginate 
concentration . Figure 1.c depicts the evolution of the non -frozen water volume fraction 
(𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙  𝜙𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ) and alginate volume fraction ( 𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙  𝜙𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒 ) in between ice crystals after freezing 
different alginate -water binary mixtures from room temperature to −80 ℃ at 10 ℃.𝑚𝑖𝑛−1. The local 
composition in between ice crystals was found to be independent of the initial alginate -water 
composition up to 𝜙=0.6 (dark grey and magenta data points). Above this alginate volume fraction no 
ice melting endotherm was detected upon heating the samples from -80 °C to 40 °C, suggesting that no 
ice crys tallization took place during freezing . Under these circumstances all water was considered as 
non-freezing water (a thorough discussion of the nature of freezable and non -freezable water in presence 
of polysaccharides is available elsewhere and is beyond t he scope of this work35). As a consequence, no 
phase segregation occurred and the local composition of the polymer -rich phase after fr eezing was 
similar to the initial mixtures (lighter grey and magenta data  points). The intersection between the 
liquidus  curve  and the glass transition curves  (Figure 1.b) thus defines  the local composition of the 
segregated phase for 𝜙<0.6. This critical  polymer volume fraction will be referred to hereafter as 
𝜙𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡. For a ll practical uses in cell cryopreservation , polysaccharide  concentrations is lower than  𝜙𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡. 
The consequences from a cryopreservation standpoint are important  since the se data suggests that 6 
 regardless of the initial concentration of polymer  (provided that 𝜙<𝜙𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡), the composition of the local 
environment surrounding cells is independent of the  initial polymer concentration and is defined  solely 
by the intersect ion between 𝑇𝑓 and 𝑇𝑔.  
Since the initial composition of alginate solutions we used in the cell cryopreservation 
experiments was limited to 𝜙=0.025 (vertical dotted line in Figure 1.b), and because the thermal 
gradient in the directional freezi ng setup is linear, it is possible to transpose the data from the phase 
diagram to establish the composition of the cell surroundings from room temperature to -80 °C during 
freezing. Such an analogy enables to describe both the temperature and composition of the ice/alginate 
solution/vitreous phase throughout the full freezing process. We thus define two moments that separate 
different polymer concentration around individual cells during freezing. At 𝑡1 (Figure 1.a) the cell 
surroundings evolved from a fixed polysaccharide concentration defined by the initial water -alginate 
mixture to experience an increase in local polymer concentration until this concentration reached 
𝜙𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 at 𝑡2 (Figu re 1.a). At 𝑡2 alginate concentration in the cells’ surrounding became constant and 
equivalent to the vitreous mixture of alginate and water defined by 𝜙𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡.  
 
 Local concentration of alginate between ice crystals  
It is commonly admitted that each cell type displays optimum viability at a specific freezing 
rate. The bell -shaped curves that describe cell viability according to  freezing rate, have supported this 
empirical statement and have provided much needed guidance in the definition of the b est 
cryopreservation protocols for different cell types.36,37 The description of the via bility according to the 
freezing rate is, however, provides only limited  insight into the different phenomena occurring during 
cryopreservation. As shown above, the composition of the interstitial zones , and thus the cellular 
environment during freez ing, depends on the intersection point between 𝑇𝑓 and 𝑇𝑔. The liquidus curve 
describes a purely thermodynamic transition  whose characteristic temperature for a given composition 
is not expected to change with the freezing rate. The glass transiti on is, on the contrary, strongly 
dependent on the heating and cooling rates38. Faster cooling rates are expected to move 𝑇𝑔 to higher 7 
 temperatures, which changes the intersection point between 𝑇𝑓 and 𝑇𝑔 and thus impacts on 𝜙𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡, the 
composition of the vitreous phase. In the following experiments we have controlled the ice front velocity 
as a strategy to modulate the freezing rate in the directional freezing setups. To ascertain the impact of 
ice front velocity on the phase segregation between ice and alginate/water gla ss during freezing, a n 
alginate solution marked  with rhodamine B was frozen under the con focal microscope setup depicted in 
Figure 2.a at 10, 20, 30 and 50 µm.s-1. Two dimensional image sequences  of the freezing phenomena 
were acquired and stabilized at th e moving front. Figure 2.b represents a section of a still image used to 
calculate the volume fraction of ice according to the distance to the ice front for the different ice front 
velocities. At least ten consecutive images were treated ( Figure S2) for ea ch ice front velocity. From the 
integration of the ice zones (in black ) the ice volume fraction as a function of the distance to the ice front 
was determined . Figure 2.c describes the progression of the ice volume fraction, 𝜙𝑖𝑐𝑒, along the x 
direction according to the ice front velocity. From the moving ice front point towards the cold element,  
𝜙𝑖𝑐𝑒 grows rapidly to attain a relatively stable regime at around 400 µm from the ice front. The ice 
volume fraction at the plateau zone is independent of the ice front velocity for 10 and 20 µm.s-1. As the 
ice front velocity increase s from 20 to 50 µm.s-1, 𝜙𝑖𝑐𝑒 at the plateau decreases from 0.9 1 to 0. 79, 
respectively. While this difference  may seem of little relevan ce to understand the local environment of 
cells during freezing, the conversion to local alginate concentration in the interstitial zones is revelatory. 
In figure 2.d , for high est ice front velocity  (50 µm.s-1), the local alginate concentration evolves fro m 4 
wt.% to attain a stable  regime at around 20 wt.%. For the lower ice front velocities  (10 and 20 µm.s-1) a 
mostly linear trend indicates that the local concentration of alginate evolves from 4 wt.% to 40 wt.%  
within the first 600 µm. The intermediate ic e front velocity, 30 µm.s-1 yields a mostly linear alginate 
concentration variation with the distance to the ice front, reaching 26 wt.% at 600 µm. These results 
clearly indicate that the local environment surrounding cells during directional freezing is l argely 
controlled by the ice front velocity. The difference in alginate concentration profile  evidenced in Figure  
2.d can be further explained by the  fact that the  lowest temperature available in the confocal setu p is -8 
°C. At high ice front velocities th e 𝑇𝑔is higher and the intersection between the liquidus line and 𝑇𝑔 is 
readily accessible at moderate temperatures such as -8 °C. This leads to reaching a plateau in 8 
 composition under the confocal microscope as observed for 50 µm.s-1. At lower ve locities the 
intersection between the liquidus line and 𝑇𝑔 can only be accessed at lower temperatures, leading the 
experiment not to attain the steady state regime.  While this limitation is present and relevant in the 
confocal setup it was fully elimi nated in the cell freezing setup used later in this work where the cold 
plate can go as low as -100 °C.     
Another aspect that was accessible from the previous data relates to  how the variation of alginate 
concentration occurs with time , for different ic e front velocities , from 𝑡1onwards. Figure 2.e describes 
the local alginate concentration increase within the accessible field view under the confocal microscope 
setup, from the ice front to 600 µm. For low velocities, the concentration increase was progressive but 
reache d high alginate concentration (up to 40 wt.%). At higher ice front velocities the alginate 
concentration increase was sharper but reache d a far mor e limited local concentration (20 wt.%). Figure 
2.f depicts the initial concentration inc rease immediately after 𝑡1. The slope s of the linear fits show a 
marked difference in the initial concentration variation ranging from 1.3 to 7.1 wt%.s-1 for 10 and 50 
µm.s-1, respectively.   
It is thus reasonable to hypothesize that, in directional freezing, the ice front vel ocity can play 
two major roles  impacting cell behavior . The first is relate d with the final composition of the vitreous 
alginate -water phase  surrounding the cells  that varies from 20 to 40 wt% by solely modifying the ice 
front velocity  from 50 to 10 µm.s-1, respectively . This may account for important variations in cell 
viability since the hydration of the storage medium will, in the present  water -polysaccharide system in 
the absence of pCPA s, define the osmotic pressure difference between the intra - and ex tracellular media  
of the cell s after 𝑡2. The second role of the ice front velocity is relate d with the rate at which the polymer 
concentration change s from 𝑡1 onwards. Assuming that suspended cells will, prior to interaction with 
the freezing front , be at osmotic equilibrium with the alginate solution ( 𝜙=0.025 ,4 𝑤𝑡%), the ice front 
velocity determine s the rate at which cells will be drawn to an osmotic out-of-equilibrium situation.  
The local environment of cells during freezing is determined by  a diverse range of conditions 
that extend beyond the local concentration of polymer, as discussed so far. Another particularly 
important aspect is the fate of cells during their interaction with the freezing front. As reported 9 
 previously20, yeast cells are observed covered in a polysaccharide envelope, regardless of the ice front 
velocity used in the directional freezing ( Figure S 3). However, to establish a quantitative relationship 
between cell viability and ice front velocity we should ensure that the ratio of cells that end up within 
the interstitial space defined by ice crystals ( i.e. enveloped in alginate) over those being engu lfed directly 
by ice is independent of the ice front velocity.  
 
Cell viability  
To determine the physical environment of suspended S. cerevisiae  cells during freezing the 
home -built directional freezing setup20 (Figure 3.a) was used to freeze yeast cell suspensions at different 
ice front velocities. The three dimensional image of the fr eezing front zone, depicted in F igure 3.b 
illustrates how ice crystals (unmarked, white) segregate both alginate solution (mark ed with Rhodamine 
B (Rh -Alg), coded in magenta) and S. cerevisiae  cells (marked with FUN1 dye, coded in cyan) to form 
domains of 4 -6 µm in the y direction (after the ice crystal is fully formed, bottom of the image) separated 
by ice crystals ranging betwee n 20 and  50 µm in the y direction  (see Figure S 2). From the 3D rendered 
image, yeast cells appear covered by a magenta layer  (rhodamine B in alginate) , indicating the absence 
of direct contact between the cell wall with ice crystals. This observation was f urther confirmed by a 
sequential imaging of cells exposed to an ice front moving at 10 µm.s-1. Figure 3 .c depicts nine 
sequential fluorescence 2D images of the freezing front before, during and after the interaction of two 
suspended cells with the moving f reezing front. Two different outcomes were identified: encapsulation 
in the interstitial space defined by ice crystals (white arrows) and engulfment of th e cells in the ice 
crystals ( yellow  arrows).  The images in Figure  3.c were chosen due to the co -occurr ence of both cases 
and are not representative of the wh ole sample. Statistical analysis of the encapsulation efficiency of 
yeast cells (n > 200) by the moving ice front (Figure 3.d) performed on image sequences obtained  at 10 
and 50 µm.s-1 yield ed more tha n 85% of cells were encapsulated in the alginate -rich zones, regardless 
of the ice front velocity.   10 
 As shown above, the freezing conditions determine the final polymer concentration and the rate 
at which this concentration is attained based solely on the velocity of the freezing front. To ascertain if 
ice front velocity did translate into dif ferent cell viability when applied to yeast cell suspensions a 
dedicated directional freezing setup was built . This setup allowed  to control the freezing step between 
two well-defined thermal boundar ies closer to the temperatures relevant  in cryopreservation (Figure 
4.a). S. cerevisiae  cells suspended in alginate solution were placed between glass coverslips separated 
by a 500 µm spacer and moved from the hot block ( 𝑇𝐻=10 °𝐶) towards the cold block ( 𝑇𝐶=−100  °𝐶) 
at different linear velocities. To ascertain the impact of the ice front velocity on the viability of S. 
cerevisiae  cells during freezing, three ice front velocities, 10, 50 and 100 µm.s-1, were used . 
Experimental data describing the cooling rate according to the ice front velocity is available in the 
supporting information  (Figure S4 ). The growth curves of yeast cells were obtained in liquid growth 
conditions after directional freezing followed by controlled quick thawing to 37°C (Figure 4.b). The 
viability results support previous findings on the invers e dependency of cell viability with freezing 
rate.36,37,39  When frozen at 10 µm.s-1 (5 °C.min-1) S. cerevisiae  cell suspensions (1.5·107 cells.mL-1) 
display significantly faster growth kinetics than at higher ice front velocities (and freezing rates). 
Though significantly different from the control up to 32h, the characteristic growth curve of cell 
suspensions frozen at 10 µm.s-1 follow the control growth curve closely. This behavior is also observed 
for differ ent cell densities ranging from 1.5·106 to 1.5·108 cells.mL-1 (Figure  S5). As the ice front 
velocities increased from 10 to 50 and 100 µm.s-1 the cells’ growth kinetics decreased in a monotonic 
manner indicating the inverse dependence between cell viabilit y and the physico -chemical conditions 
determined by the ice front progression. These results were further confirmed by plate counting after a 
freeze -thawing process (Fig. 4.c). The colony forming units determined by plate counting also decreased 
monotonica lly with ice front velocity.  
 
Discussion  
Establishing a strict causal relationship between yeast  viability and the composition of the cell 
surroundings determined by the ice front velocity is not possible since a wide range of other parameters 11 
 are simultaneously at pl ay. The pressure formed in between ice crystals during ice templating and its 
dependence with ice front velocity cannot be discarded. Recent results suggest that the pressure 
generated during ice templating of a lamellar glycolipid can attain values in the  kbar range.40 Although 
only two ice front velocities were tested (9 and 15 µm.s-1), the pressure values do stand in the critical 
range for eukaryotic cells (between 1 and 3 kbar ).41 It is likely  that a  wider ice front velocity range  may 
translate into significantly different interstitial pressures  with repercussions in cell viability . Also the 
morphol ogy of the ice crystals formed during freezing are markedly different  depending on the ice front 
velocity . The minimum Feret diameter of the macroporous alginate structures observe d under SEM after 
freeze drying, displayed in the supp lementary information (Figure  S6) and the periodic distances 
obtained under the confocal microscope ( Figure S7) are relevant measure s to describe the wall -to-wall 
distance of the lamellar pores generated by the growth of ice cry stals. The  inverse scaling between ice 
crystals size and ice front velocity observed here is a common behavior  described for ice -templating of 
a variety of systems ranging from biopolymers20,42 to ceramic slurries43,44. While th e morphological 
feature may seem of little relevance to cell viability, the size and distribution of ice crystals within the 
sample may have significant impa ct during thawing of the samples , notably on their likelihood to endure 
recrystallization , a key aspect in cell injury .  
Nevertheless, we have here minimize d the unknown variables usually associated with 
cryopreservation by selecting a freezing setup with clearly defined boundary conditions that can be 
reproduced under a confocal microscope to draw a clearer picture of the cellular environment during 
freezing. We can therefore unveil, in a detailed manner , how the medium surrounding each cell evolves 
during  freezing and how the ice front velocity determines the composition of the cell environment. Based 
on the water -alginate phase diagram w e introduce the notion of vitreous moving front  as a key element 
to understand how the medium concentration evolves  over time during freezing.  Of especial importance 
is the impact of the ice front velocity on the evolution of the concentration of the polymer solute 
surrounding cells. Increasing the ice front velocity led to a lower concentration of alginate within the 
interstitial space where cells are confined. This evolution could lead to a lower osmotic pressure 
difference between the extracellular and the intracellular spaces and thus to less osmotic stress. In this 12 
 regard, fast ice front velocity would seem a favorable condition to maximize cell viability . However, an 
attentive  look at the initial solute concentration rate  of change between 𝑡1 and 𝑡2 shows very large 
variation , up to 7.1 wt%.s-1, at high velocity,  whereas this value was as low as 1.7 wt%.s-1 for slower 
ones. We hypothesize that this slow rate of solute concentration change is a central parameter behind 
the increased viability of cells frozen at 10 µm.s-1. Higher rates may not allow to reach an equilibrium 
state between the intra - and extracellular  osmotic forces , leading to an excess of cytoplasmic  water and 
therefore inefficient inhibition of intracellular  ice growth  by solute/crowding effects . 
Coupling microscopic observation during directional freezing of cells with the thermal analysis 
of the freezing medium enable d to characterize the cell local environment during freezing . To the best 
of our knowledge , describing the composition of the freezing media surrounding cells during freezing 
has never been accomplished. Here we  experimentally quantify  the evolution of the concentration of a 
polysaccharide -based medium during freezing and we establish that its final concentration is 
independent from its initial concentration  in solution  below a critical value . We describe the vitreous 
nature of the poly saccharide surrounding cells as it accumulates in the interstitial space defined by ice 
crystals . Most transformations in concentration occur between the time points that mediate between the 
passage of the moving ice front and the moving vitreous front, a concept we introduce for the first time.  
These observations strengthen  the role of controlled ice front velocity in cryopres ervation , a factor often 
overlooked in cooling rate control  experiments . Due to the eminently kinetic nature of the vitreous 
transition, we prove that the different composition of  the cell surroundings depends  on the ice front 
velocity used during freezing.  
These results provide a more detailed insight into the osmotic stress endured by cells during 
cryopreservation  due to the local increase in medium concentration , an information that has remained 
elusive up to now. Furthermore , the correlative approach developed  here should allow to achieve  a 
deeper understanding of the freezing mecha nisms of biological materials and provide quantitative data 
to rationalize cell survival during  cryopreservation, an essential step to achieve better freezing protocols 
in absence of toxic cryoprotectants.

 Materials and Methods  
DSC  – Differential Scanning Calorimetry  was performed  to study the therm al behavior  of 
alginate/water mixture s. In a typical experiment, 20 mg of different composition  varying from 4  wt.% 
to 80 wt.%  were sealed in  aluminum crucible s and left to homogenize for one week at ambient 
temp erature. To analyse the fraction of frozen water, s amples were cooled to -80 °C at –10 °C.min-1 
followed by heating back to room temperature. The ice melt endotherm  was analy zed to understand the 
local composition of composition of the final system . The co mparison between ice melting endotherm 
integration and the amount of introduced  water allowed the quantification of the  amount of non-freezing 
water  associated with the polymer fraction according with the initial alginate concentration. To describe 
the cry oscopic depression, samples were cyclically cooled to -80 °C and heated back the temperature 
corresponding to the middle of the melt endotherm. Upon each cycle the return temperature between 
heating and cooling ramps was shifted of 0.5 °C towards lo wer tem peratures to overcome  supercooling . 
All DSC analysis were performed in a TA Instruments Q20 DSC  instrument coupled with a cooling 
flange. The conversion between mass and volume fraction is according to the equation (S.eq.1) in the 
supplementary information . 
Directional freezing under confocal microscopy  – The confocal microscopy system designed to 
inspect the ice front during directional freezing25 was composed of  a temperature control ler connected 
to two independent  Peltier elements (ET -127-10-13, Adaptive , purchased from RS Components, France) 
coupled with a controlled XY stage . The distance between th e thermal  elements was 2 mm. The freezing 
process was observed under a Confocal Laser Scanning Platform Leica TCS SP8 (Leica Microsystems  
SAS,  Germany). For the analysis of the polymer fraction, rhodamine B (0.1 mM) was dissolved in 4 
wt% alginate solution . The obtained fluorescent solution was injected inside  Hele -Shaw cells. The filled 
Hele -Shaw cell were  moved from the hot to the cold Peltier  elements (temperature ranged from 12 to -
8 °C) by a stepper motor at 10 , 20, 30 and 50 μm .s-1 linear  velocities ,. The ice crystal and corresponding 
segregated polymer volume fraction s were analyzed with FIJI software45. For cell imaging during 
freezing , S. cerevisiae  cells (around 1.5 ·107 cells.mL-1) stained with LIVE/DEAD™ Yeast Viability Kit  
(L7009, ThermoFisher Scientific) were mixed with algi nate solution in presence of Rhodamine B (0.1 14 
 mM) for 30 minutes. The sample s were then  imaged during freezing as they crossed the thermal gradient 
at 10 and 50 μm.s-1. Image analysis was performed using  Fiji software45. The encapsulation efficiency 
of yeast cells (stained by SYTO 9  and propidi um iodide , both obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific ) 
was obtained from counting cel ls trapped inside of alginate walls or ice column (n > 200).  
Cell culture – 10 mg of dry Saccharomyces cerevisiae  cells (obtained from SIGMA -ALDRICH) 
were suspended in 1 ml pH 7.2 PBS solution . Subsequently  10 μl of cell suspension  were pipetted into 
10 ml Yeast Extract  Peptone  Dextrose (YPD) culture medi um. Cell suspensions were then placed  in an 
incubator at 30 °C, 150 rpm for 30 hours. Cells were harvested after centrifugation at  6000 rpm for 10 
minutes a nd resuspended in 0.9  wt.% NaCl solution for the following experiments.  
Directional freezing  of yeast cells  – The setup was composed of two temperature -controlled 
aluminum plates (12×10×1.5 cm) used as cold (𝑇𝐶=−100 ±5 ℃) and hot element  (𝑇𝐻=10±2 ℃)  
and a motor  to slide the  samples  between both aluminum plates . The cold plate was refrigerated via a 
copper element plunged into liquid Nitrogen. The hot plate was controlled by a circulating flow of water 
from a nearby temperature controlled bath.  The distance between th e two plates was set to 2 mm. 
Mixture of 4  wt.% sodium alginate  aqueous solution and yeast cells (fina l concentration, 1.5 ·107 
cells. ml-1) was stabilized for 30 minutes at room temperature and injected into a sample holder (a g lass 
coverslip sealed with a 500 µm  culture chamber from Thermo Fisher Scientific) . Prior to freezing, a 
stabilization period (30 mins. at 𝑇𝐻) was systematically applied for the samples to attain  thermal 
equilibrium, upon which the samples moved at 10 , 50 or 100 μm .s-1 from the hot to the cold element. 
Once the sample was fully frozen and reached  the edge of the cold element  it was stored at -80 °C for 
12 h. The frozen sample s were fully thawed in a water bath at 37 °C for 15 seconds. To ascertain cell  
regrowth after freezing and thawing, 120 μl of each thawed  solution was dispersed into  10 ml fresh YPD 
broth medi um and incubat ed at 30 °C, 150 rpm. Aliquots  were drawn  at 8, 12, 24, 28, 32, 48, 56 h and  
optical density at 600 nm was tracked using a UV sp ectrometer (UVIKONXL SECOMAM). Three 
replicates were performed for each ice front velocity.  Directional freezing  was performed at  different 
cell densities, ranging from 1.5·106 to 1.5·108 cells. mL-1. The same freezing , sampling and the 15 
 subsequent OD measur ement  procedures described above were applied. Three replicates were 
performed for each cell density.  
Cell viability assay  – Cell viability assay was performed by plate counting. The frozen sample s 
(ca. 300 µL) obtained after directional freezing  were taken out from the -80 °C freezer and thawed in a 
water bath at 37 °C for 15 seconds. Subsequently, 120 μl of the samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm 
and resuspended in 200 μl 0.9  wt.% NaCl solution. Samples were diluted to 1/10 , 1/100 and 1 /1000 X. 
For plate co unting, 100 μl of each of the diluted samples were pipetted onto the YPD agar surface (three 
replicates for each condition) and spreaded  with a sterile plastic  cell spreader . Agar plates were then put 
inside an  incubator at 30 °C for 24 h  and c ell colonies  were counted by visual inspection.  
SEM  – After directional freezing , samples were freeze -dried (ALPHA 2 -4 LD, Bioblock 
Scientific , 0.1 mbar, at condenser temperature -80 °C ) for 24 hours. The dried foams were cut 
perpendicular to the ice front growth direc tion (revealing the pores’ cross section) and parallel to the ice 
growth direction (revealing the pores’ alignment) and fixed to a metal SEM holder using carbon tape . 
Samples were sputtered with 10 nm gold layer and imaged on a Hitachi S -3400N scanning  electron  
microscope at 10 kV beam acceleration voltage . Subsequent SEM image analysis were performed with 
FIJI software45.

Figure 1. Phase segregation of alginate/water solution  (L) during directional freezing enables controlled 
phase separation into ice  (I) and a vitreous phase  (V). a) Diagram of the freezing profil e and  phase 
separation during ice growth. At 𝑡1, cells are brought into contact with the freezing front and enter the 
interstitial space defined by ice crystals . Between t 1 and t 2 cells experience an increasingly concentrated 
solution phase that co -exists with ice. When the composition and temperature of the interstitial space 
attain  𝜙𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡, defined as the intersection between the liquidus and 𝑇𝑔 lines , the cells become entrapped in 
a vitreous phase . b) Phase diagram of alginate/water soluti on. Magenta points describe the cryoscopic 
depression of alginate/water mixtures as determined by DSC  at 10 °C.min-1. Liquidus curve is defined 
by equation 2 and theoretical 𝑇𝑔 calculated according to Gordon Taylor model  is defined by equation 3 . 
c) The composition of segregated phase upon freezing according to initial alginate concentration. Non -
freezing water contained in the segregated phase, in magenta , is determined by the difference between 
the total amount of water in the solution and the amount  of water  determined by the melting enthalpy of 
the frozen fraction. In black , alginate composition in the segregated phase  according to the initial

Confocal image treatment for volume fraction analysis  
Image sequences of at least 10 consecutive frames were treated with a 2pixel median filter and rotated 
so that the ice front was horizontal. A 600*600 Gaussian blur filter was applied to  each frame  to extract 
a background intensity mask. Initial images were then divided by the obtained masks. A drift correction 
was applied using a movie stabilization macro by Nicholas Schneider (available from 
https://github.com/NMSchneider/fixTranslation -Macro -for-
31 
 ImageJ/bl ob/master/NMS_fixTranslation_ver1.ijm ) to stabilize the ice moving front. Image sequences  
were cropped to remove stabilization artifacts at the image edges. All images extended for at least 600 
µm below the ice front. Image sequences were subsequently bina rized using a Huang threshold between 
0 and 39, rotated  by 90° and their profile integrated.
