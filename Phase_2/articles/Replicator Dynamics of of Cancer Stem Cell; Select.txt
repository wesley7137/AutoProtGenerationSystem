Title: Replicator Dynamics of of Cancer Stem Cell; Selection in the Presence of
  Differentiation and Plasticity
Abstract:   Stem cells have the potential to produce lineages of non-stem cell
populations (differentiated cells) via a ubiquitous hierarchal division scheme.
Differentiation of a stem cell into (partially) differentiated cells can happen
either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The selection dynamics of a mutant
cancer stem cell should be investigated in the light of a stem cell
proliferation hierarchy and presence of a non-stem cell population. By
constructing a three-compartment Moran-type model composed of normal stem
cells, mutant (cancer) stem cells and differentiated cells, we derive the
replicator dynamics of stem cell frequencies where asymmetric differentiation
and differentiated cell death rates are included in the model. We determine how
these new factors change the conditions for a successful mutant invasion and
discuss the variation on the steady state fraction of the population as
different model parameters are changed. By including the phenotypic
plasticity/dedifferentiation, in which a progenitor/differentiated cell can
transform back into a cancer stem cell, we show that the effective fitness of
mutant stem cells is not only determined by their proliferation and death rates
but also according to their dedifferentiation potential. By numerically solving
the model we derive the phase diagram of the advantageous and disadvantageous
phases of cancer stem cells in the space of proliferation and dedifferentiation
potentials. The result shows that at high enough dedifferentiation rates even a
previously disadvantageous mutant can take over the population of normal stem
cells. This observation has implications in different areas of cancer research
including experimental observations that imply metastatic cancer stem cell
types might have lower proliferation potential than other stem cell phenotypes
while showing much more phenotypic plasticity and can undergo clonal expansion.

Abstract
The cancer stem cell hypothesis has evolved into one of the most important
paradigms in cancer research. According to cancer stem cell hypothesis, so-
matic mutations in a subpopulation of cells can transform them into cancer stem
cells with the unique potential of tumour initiation. Stem cells have the poten-
tial to produce lineages of non-stem cell populations (dierentiated cells) via a
ubiquitous hierarchal division scheme. Dierentiation of a stem cell into (par-
tially) dierentiated cells can happen either symmetrically or asymmetrically.
The selection dynamics of a mutant cancer stem cell should be investigated
in the light of a stem cell proliferation hierarchy and presence of a non-stem
cell population. By constructing a three-compartment Moran-type model com-
posed of normal stem cells, mutant (cancer) stem cells and dierentiated cells,
we derive the replicator dynamics of stem cell frequencies where asymmetric
dierentiation and dierentiated cell death rates are included in the model. We
determine how these new factors change the conditions for a successful mutant
invasion and discuss the variation on the steady state fraction of the popula-
tion as dierent model parameters are changed. By including the phenotypic
plasticity/dedierentiation, in which a progenitor/dierentiated cell can trans-
form back into a cancer stem cell, we show that the eective tness of mutant
stem cells is not only determined by their proliferation and death rates but
also according to their dedierentiation potential. By numerically solving the
model we derive the phase diagram of the advantageous and disadvantageous
phases of cancer stem cells in the space of proliferation and dedierentiation
potentials. The result shows that at high enough dedierentiation rates even a
previously disadvantageous mutant can take over the population of normal stem
cells. This observation has implications in dierent areas of cancer research in-
cluding experimental observations that imply metastatic cancer stem cell types
might have lower proliferation potential than other stem cell phenotypes while
showing much more phenotypic plasticity and can undergo clonal expansion.

According to clonal evolution theory, most tumours arise from single cells
through multiple genetic alterations accumulated over time. However, the can-
cer stem cell hypothesis suggests that cancer cells with similar genetic back-
ground originate from a transformed cell which can initiate the rest of tu-
mour population (Bonnet and Dick, 1997)(Lapidot et al, 1994)(Eppert et al,
2011)(Meacham and Morrison, 2013). This subpopulation of tumour initiating
cells, known as cancer stem cells, are hypothesized to be a result of somatic
mutations of a normal adult stem cell giving it a proliferative advantage and
as a result generating clonal outgrowth in the tissue which leads to the for-
mation of a neoplasm (Perou et al, 2000)(Srlie et al, 2001)(Vogelstein et al,
2013). Combination of these mutation/proliferation mechanisms and microen-
vironmental factors leads to dierent stages of cancer progression (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2000)(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011), which results in genetically and
phenotypically heterogeneous tumours (Notta et al, 2011).
Stem cells can divide both symmetrically into two daughter stem cells (self-
renewal) or two daughter progenitor cells (full dierentiation), or asymmetrically
into a daughter stem cell and a progenitor cell (partial dierentiation) . Pro-
genitor cells then divide hierarchically into a population of fully dierentiated
functional tissue cells which lack proliferative potential (Morrison and Kimble,
2006). This polarity in cancer stem cell division is observed in dierent cancer
types. For breast carcinomas, it has been shown that activating the ErbB2
oncogene increases the self-renewal potential of cancer stem cells signicantly
(Cicalese et al, 2009). Similarly, p53 inactivation leads to not only almost im-
mortal stem cells but also a higher divisional polarity (Cicalese et al, 2009).
p53 is also reported to impose an asymmetric proliferation potential on other
non-stem cell linages (Rambhatla et al, 2001); see also (Caussinus and Gonzalez,
2005).
In addition to the tumour initiating potential of cancer stem cells, another
distinctive feature of cancer cells is their high phenotypic plasticity. One aspect
of such plasticity is the dedierentiation potential possessed by stem cell progen-
itors. During dedierentiation progenitors (or dierentiated cells) can transform
back spontaneously into a stem cell thus lending further credence to the vivid
concept of cancer stem cells as tumour initiating cell (Marjanovic et al, 2013).
Recent in-vitro experiments have demonstrated the dedierentiation potential
of dierent cancer type cell lines. For breast cancer, puried populations of non-
stem cells, CD44low=CD24hi(basal and luminal cell lines), created a population
of CD44hi=CD24low, which is a marker for stemness (Gupta et al, 2011). It
has been also shown that a population where the majority are non-stem cells,
CD44low=CD24hi, gives rise to a higher mammosphere formation rate which
is a measure of stemness (Chaer et al, 2011). The role of dedierentiation in
2intestinal tumorigenesis is investigated in (Schwitalla et al, 2013), where it is
shown that elevating the levels of the transcription factor NF  B, which mod-
ulate Wnt signaling, induces dedierentiation in the (non-stem cell) intestinal
epithelial cell population and thus can lead to tumourigenesis. In the context of
leukaemia, the leukemia-initiating cell marker CD34+CD38 has been observed
in the fraction of non-leukemia initiating cells (Bonnet and Dick, 1997)(Sarry
et al, 2011).
It has been suggested that as cancer progresses towards more aggressive
metastatic phenotypes, the dedierentiation potential increases (Marjanovic
et al, 2013). The dedierentiation of non-stem cells may arise due to (stochasti-
cally) genetic or epigenetic mutations, or the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), a cellular dierentiation process wherein epithelial cells adopt mes-
enchymal features (Marjanovic et al, 2013). It has been shown that EMT in-
duced cells have a higher dedierentiation potential while at the same time they
display features resembling stem cell (Chaer et al, 2013)(Scheel and Weinberg,
2011) (Mani et al, 2008). Thus, beside the mutation/clonal expansion model
of cancer progression which leads to genomic heterogeneity in the tumour pop-
ulation, inclusion of hierarchal stem cell proliferation and the dedierentiation
potential of cells leads to more phenotypic heterogeneity inside a tumour. More
importantly, cell plasticity shadows the concept of stem cells, in the sense that
we cannot compare the two populations of normal and cancer stem cells com-
peting via their corresponding proliferation strengths, but rather the population
of non-stem cells has to be included in the picture of the selection process and
Darwinian evolution of the tumour.
Mathematical models of selection processes so far have treated the selec-
tion mechanism among cancer stem cell populations and normal population
assuming higher division rate for mutants due to activation and inactivations of
oncogenes/tumour suppressor genes that regulate the growth factor signalling
pathways inside the cell. These models were able to successfully describe the
selection process occurring prior to each new clonal expansion (due to a new
mutation). The dynamics of tumour suppressor gene inactivation in particular
has been investigated in the literature in detail (Komarova et al, 2003)(Nowak
et al, 2004)(Michor et al, 2004); see (Attolini and Michor, 2009) for a thorough
review of evolutionary modelling in cancer. However, there has not been much
work with regard to stem cell hierarchy proliferation potential and its eect on
selection dynamics. Some recent works have focused on the asymmetric nature
of stem cell division. (Dingli et al, 2007) studied the time to xation of mu-
tant stem cell selection using a simplied birth-death model of two stem cell
population which divides asymmetrically, ignoring the population progenitors
and dierentiated cells (perhaps for simplicity). A recent computational study
by Sprouske et al (Sprouske et al, 2013), has investigated the eect of an
asymmetric division scheme for stem cells by simulating stem cells with random
tness and have discussed Darwinian selection and the existence of disadvanta-
geous subpopulations in the formation of neoplasms. Shahriyari and Komarova
(?) has also addressed the evolutionary advantage/disadvantages of symmetric
versus asymmetric dierentiation by constructing a Moran-type process for one
3and two-hit mutation models and have analyzed the eect of dierentiated cell
compartment in the eectiveness of the mutations among stem cell compart-
ment. More recently, Jilkine and Gutenkunst ( ?) considered a stochastic model
for dierentiation and dedierentiation and investigated time to mutation ac-
quisition in the presence of dedierentiation mechanism for progenitors of stem
cells. They also discussed how asymmetric versus symmetric dierentiation can
aect the eciency of dedierentiation process. The cancer stem cell hypoth-
esis has also been applied in the context of drug resistance as an evolutionary
process by Leder et al (Leder et al, 2010).
The present work aims to provide a general framework to study the selection
dynamics of cancer versus normal stem cells by including asymmetric dierenti-
ation, in addition to stem cell self-renewal. This introduces a more challenging
mathematical model which now contains two competing stem cell populations
and a third dierentiated cell compartment, which now both stem cells popu-
lations are competing with. By introducing a Moran-type stochastic model for
this three-compartment model, we derive replicator-type dynamics for the three
populations of cancer stem cells, normal stem cells and dierentiated cells as
a function of time. We show that the condition for successful invasion by the
cancer stem cells not only depends on their higher division rate or lower death
rate, but also on dierentiation rate or polarity of their asymmetric division. In
constructing the birth-death model we assume three independent parameters for
the death rates of mutant stem cells, normal stem cells and the dierentiated cell
population. An important feature of our model is that dedierentiation events
can be naturally added to the model. We discuss dedierentiation (assumed
only for cancer stem cells) in detail and show that the proliferation advantage is
not only a function of relative tness of two stem cells and their corresponding
dierentiation rates but also depends on the strength of plasticity and on the
population of non-stem cells. We plot a phase diagram between advantageous
and disadvantageous regimes in the space of tness, plasticity and, dierenti-
ation probabilities. We show that assuming nite dedierentiation rates (con-
sistent with numerical estimate from experiments) a seemingly disadvantageous
mutant can successfully initiate clonal expansion into a neoplasm.
The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2 we formulate a Moran-type
model of stem cell dierentiation and dedierentiation and report the replica-
tor dynamics in the presence of dierentiation and dedierentiation potentials.
We also discuss the analytical result of the xation time for this model in the
absence of dedierentiation. In Sec. 3 we discuss numerical solutions of the
replicator dynamics and investigate the population dynamics and average time
to xation of a mutant stem cell as one varies division rates of the stem cell
population, relative death rates of stem cells and dierentiated cells and dif-
ferentiation probabilities. Similarly, we look at time to xation and whether
a mutant is advantageous or disadvantageous by varying both relative division
rates and dedierentiation potential. In Sec. 4 we discuss the implications for
cancer therapeutics and also possible future directions of investigation.
42. Replicator Dynamics of Dierentiation and Dedierentiation
We consider a model of two stem cell populations and a population of par-
tially/fully dierentiated cells (Fig. 2). Normal stem cells divide with a rate
r1and die with rate d1per generation. In each division event, a stem cell can
divide (1) symmetrically into two daughter stem cells with probability !1, (2)
asymmetrically into one daughter stem cell and one progenitor with probability
u1and (3) fully dierentiate into two daughter progenitor cells with probability
v1(Fig. 3). The probabilities !1;u1andv1add up to unity. Similarly, mutant
stem cell proliferation and death rates are denoted by r2andd2. Correspond-
ingly, self-renewal and dierentiation probabilities are !2;u2andv2. In the
hierarchal stem cell proliferation scheme, the number of transient progenitors
are nite thus by including all dierentiated cell population into one compart-
ment, we assume that the only possibility for this population to increase is the
case in which a stem cell dierentiates symmetrically or asymmetrically. Thus
we assume that the dierentiated compartment lacks proliferation potential of
its own. The death rate of dierentiated cells are commonly higher than normal
and cancer stem cells and is denoted as dD.
To biologically justify the model described above, consider an intestinal crypt
which constitutes part of the colon. The crypt has a U-shaped one-dimensional
arrangement of cells where at the bottom, few stem cells proliferate and augment
the proliferation of the rest of the cells. On top of the stem cells, there is a range
of transient progenitor cells which constitute most of the body of the crypt and
end up to a population of fully functional dierentiated cells. Due to both
geometrical constraints and homeostasis regulation, the total population of the
whole crypt - and not only the population of stem cells at the bottom - can be
considered constant (see Fig. 1).

Figure 1: Schematics of three-compartment model of cancer/normal stem cell and dierenti-
ated cells for an intestinal crypt.
We consider a Moran-type of birth-death process in which, at every time
5step, one stem cell is chosen to divide at random with probability proportional
to its tness. The cell division includes all the possible self-renewal and dier-
entiation events. Dierentiated cells do not contribute to birth events as they
lack any proliferation potential. At the same time step, another stem cell or
dierentiated cell is picked at random to die. This construction keeps the total
population of the whole system of stem cells plus dierentiated cells constant.
We can examine the dynamics of the selection mechanism by analyzing this
model. Notice the dierences between this model and the conventional Moran
model, where there are only two populations of normal and mutant cells and at
every time step a birth and death event occurs. In our model, birth events do
not necessarily increase the total number of either of the stem cell populations
but rather can be a dierentiation process in which the non-stem cell popula-
tion increases in number, while the number of stem cells is reduced or remains
constant. Our construction is also dierent from that of (Dingli et al, 2007)
which incorporated dierentiation events as an independent death event. For a
conventional Moran model, the population dynamics is described by a replicator
ODE for the fraction of mutant stem cells, x(t) (Moran et al, 1962)(Wodarz and
Komarova, 2005),

If ~r>1 the mutant is advantageous, if ~ r<1 the mutant is disadvantageous.
The case ~r= 1 is the marginal neutral limit where stochastic uctuation and
nite-population eects are important in determining the fate of a single mu-
tant. In the presence of asymmetric dierentiation and the third population of
(dierentiated) cells, we generalize the above simple criteria for a mutant stem
cell being advantageous. The population dynamics of the two stem cell popu-
lations can be obtained as a non-linear system of coupled ODEs (see Appendix

Attractive xed points of Eq. 4 determine the possible steady state frac-

there are two xed points for this model, x
1;2along each of the two x1andx2
axes. It is importance to notice that one of the two xed points, x
1;2is globally
attractive and the other is a saddle-point. The attractive xed-point determines
the advantageous population that is capable of taking over a fraction of the
whole population. As the rest of the population is made of only non-stem cells.
A straightforward stability analysis for both xed points leads to an algebraic
condition to determine the advantageous versus non-advantageous phenotypes
in the presence of dierentiation. One can readily check the following condition
for a successful mutant,
r2(!2 v2)
d2r1(!1 v1)
d1: (7)
It turns out that the change in the dierentiated cells death rate (which in
fact is representative of how fast transient cells are dividing and fully-dierentiated
cells are dying) does not change the critical value of the eective tness that
determines a neutral system. Variation in the value of dD, however, does change
the fraction of mutant stem cells in the stationary state and also aects how
long it takes to reach xation (time to xation).
The denominator of Eq. 4 is quite essential in determining the time to
xation for an advantageous mutant. One can derive (see Appendix B) an
analytical result for this xation time in the case of equal death rates d1;2;D= 1,
tF=r2+1

where 1=Nis the initial fraction of the mutant stem cells (see Appendix B).
As dierentiation probabilities increase the second term contribution abruptly
increases leading to higher time to xation. Interestingly u1;2=v1;2= 1=3 is
the limit where time to xation blows up to innity.
It is also instructive to follow the trajectory, starting with one mutant stem
cell (x2;i= 1=N). As indicated by a horizontal trajectory in Fig. 4, the fre-
quency of mutant cells remain constant indicating that initially dierentiation
of normal stem cells is a major mechanism until the trajectory gets close to
the xed point of normal cells, i.e. dierentiated cells get saturated. The rest
of the trajectory is a diagonal line that connects the two xed points to each
other. For the case of identical dierentiation probabilities, 1=2we get
x2= x1, indicating that the selection dynamics, similar to the Moran
model, is at work, and the eect of dierentiation is a shift in the eective total
population ( N!N nD). In the case of dierent dierentiation rates which
is of interest to us, we can see the line of attraction does have a slope and thus
dierentiation eect acts to change the eective total population and also to
amplify the frequency of the mutant population.
Beginning from a small dierentiated cell fraction (see Fig.4), we see that
the trajectories tends to stay at an almost constant value for x2, whilex1is de-
creasing, i.e the competition is initially between dierentiated cells and normal

cells. As time passes and the dierentiated cell population reaches a saturated
value the eective competition is going to be between the two stem cell popu-
lations. In three-population models of selection, this sequential behaviour for
selection is known as Hill-robertson interference (for example see ( ?)). This is
in fact an important observation, as the model predicts that there is a always a
(relatively large) pool of dierentiated cell population present as the two stem
cell populations are competing thus when dedierentiated events are going to
be taken into account (next section).
2.1. Dedierentiation and Plasticity
We can introduce dedierentiation into this model in a similar fashion as
a back-mutation event for dierentiated cells. To incorporate mutation events
into a Moran process, we can regard it as an asymmetric division event where
one phenotype asymmetrically divides and gives rise to one daughter cell of
its own type and one daughter cell of the mutant phenotype (see (Komarova
et al, 2003)(Wodarz and Komarova, 2005)). In the case of plasticity - as back
mutation- we assume that a dierentiated cell can asymmetrically divide into
a daughter dierentiated cell and a daughter mutant stem cell. The rate of
division is indicated by q. This is accompanied by a death event of either a
dierentiated cell or a mutant stem cell with the same death rate as model
indicates. The slight dierence that appears in our construction is that we need
a mutation event for dierentiated cells to transform back into mutant stem cells
and into the normal population. Thus, only the dierentiated cell division are
accompanied with either mutant or dierentiated cell death events. Thus there
is a correlation between birth-death dedierentiation events by construction.
10As normal stem cells are assumed to be well regulated and follow the stem
cell proliferation hierarchy we ignore the possibility of dedierentiation for the
normal population.
To reduce the number of parameters, we assume the death rates of all pop-
ulations are equal, d1;2;D= 1:0. Now the population dynamics can be written
in terms of the ratio of r2andr1and the dedierentiation rate, q. Derivation
of the transition probability for the dedierentiation events are presented in
Appendix A,

dt=r22x2 x2(r1x1+r2x2) +q(1 x1 x2)2
((r1 q)x1+ (r2 q)x2+q); (9)
where the term q(1 x1 x2)2is added to the dynamics of mutant cells. The
dynamics of normal stem cells are untouched other than modication to the
total possible events (denominator of equations) which now includes an eective
proliferation event of dierentiated cells with rate q.
In the presence of dedierentiation, the fate of a new mutant is not only
determined by its relative proliferation rate, rbut also by the dedierentiation
rate of non-stem cell population, q. Notice that the dierentiation dynamics is
essential and has to be included, as the dierentiation rates essentially deter-
mine what fraction of the total population is made up of dierentiated cells and
thus aect the dedierentiation rate. For example if dierentiation rates are
low and we begin with a population of normal stem cells and introduce a dis-
advantageous mutant to this system, the mutant will become extinct. However,
if the dierentiation rates are high enough the population of dierentiated cells
- created via dierentiation - can actively contribute to increasing the mutant
population.
In the construction of the model we did not make a distinction between dif-
ferentiated cells with the capability of phenotypic plasticity and normal dieren-
tiated cells. Dividing the non-stem cell population into plastic and non-plastic
populations, however, will only change the eective value of the dedierentia-
tion rate,q, and is not crucial for our analysis. For stochastic analysis of the
xation probability, however, such a distinction might be needed.

system will evolve to one of the two xed points which contain stem cells, due
to phenotypic plasticity.
We have depicted the phase portrait of the stem cell dynamics in Fig. 5.
While the vertical xed point of mutant stem cells is not globally stable for
r2=r1= 0:8, upon introduction of a nite value of dedierentiation, the role of
the two xed points switches and the mutant is now advantageous (Fig. 5b).

new xed point (previously called x
2now have non-zero values of normal and mutant stem
cells indicating the possibility of co-existence between the two population in the presence of
dedierentiation. Notice the co-existence can only occur when the disadvantageous mutant
becomes advantageous in the presence of dedierentiation).
In the next section we analyze the numerical solutions of both replicator
dynamics in detail. The numerical solutions will let us calculate the time to
xation of the model as a function of proliferation and dierentiation rates of
normal and cancer stem cells as well as death rates of all three populations.
3. Numerical Results
3.1. Time to Fixation and Steady State Fraction of Cancer Stem Cell
We numerically integrate the system of equations in Eq. 4 and plot (Fig. 6)
the stem cell frequencies as function of proliferation and death rates in addition
to dierentiation probabilities. In addition to time to xation, the value of
the steady state fractions can be read o from these plots. In most of the
cancer initiation cases, the population of normal and dierentiated cells are
in equilibrium prior to introduction of the mutant stem cell. The equilibrium
12fraction between stem cells and dierentiated cells dier from tissue to tissue but
normally stem cells constitute a small minority. This is reected in our choice
of initial conditions. The initial frequency of normal stem cells is taken to be
0.5 while the mutant frequency is 0.01. In Fig. 6a proliferation parameters
read asr2= 1:2;r1= 1:0;d1;2;D= 1:0. As it is believed that most of the
dierentiation events occur asymmetrically, i.e., v1;21, we choose v1;2= 0:0
and look at the population dynamics of both stem cell species as u1is varied for
two dierent values of u2= 0.1, Fig. 6 (top), and u2= 0.3, Fig. 6 (bottom).
The mutant stem cell is always assumed advantageous with r2=r1= 1:2. Notice,
while relative tness in the absence of dierentiation is bigger than unity, for
low dierentiation rates of normal cells and high dierentiation rates of cancer
stem cells Fig. 6 ( u1= 0:1;u2= 0:3) the normal stem cells have a selective
advantage. Also the increase in time to xation is apparent as one decreases the
dierentiation rate of normal stem cells. For the normal stem cell frequency,
there is a peak at early times which begins to decrease monotonically. As
discussed in the previous section, this early increase in the population of both
stem cells indicates that there is an early competition between stem cells and
dierentiated cells before dierentiated cells reach saturation and stem cells
begin to compete with each other. As the values of dierentiation probabilities
is decreased we observe an increase in time to xation (time to reach plateau
in Fig. 6) . This is in accordance with the exact analytical result for time to
xationtF, Eq. 8.
Time to xation is also plotted directly from integration of Eq. 4 as a
function of both relative tness and dierentiation rates. This is plotted in Fig.
7. Again, as is expected from Eq. 8, time to xation dramatically reduces as
division ratio r2=r1increases as a function of asymmetric dierentiation rate of
cancer stem cells.
As discussed in the previous section, the eective tness is in fact indepen-
dent of the value of dDas can be seen from the condition in Eq. 7. However,
changingdDaects the nal frequency of mutant stem cells. This can be seen
in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a is plotted with parameter values r1= 1;r2= 1:2;u1;2=
0:3;v1;2= 0:0;d1;2= 1:0;dD=1.0 (magenta), 3.0 (green), 5.0 (blue), 7.0 (red).
Finally, we plot the fraction of mutant stem cells as a function of both dDand
the asymmetric dierentiation rate of mutant cells, u2in Fig. 9.
3.2. Cancer Stem Cell Dynamics in the Presence of Dedierentiation
In the presence of dedierentiation Eq. 9 can be solved for dierent values of
dedierentiation and proliferation rates of normal and cancer stem cells. Pop-
ulation dynamics of stem cell frequencies is plotted (Fig. 10) as dierentiation
rates change. In Fig. 10 (top) a disadvantageous mutant with r2=r1= 0.8 is
assumed. As one can see, upon increasing the dedierentiation rate from 0 to
0.6, the mutant invasive fate changes. For q= 0:2;0:4;0:6, as a matter of fact,
the mutant is advantageous. Change of dierentiation rates also play an impor-
tant role in the dedierentiation dynamics. Dedierentiation not only depends
on the rate of conversion and phenotype switching of non-stem cells but also

on the population of non-stem cells itself. Based on our model this is not sur-
prising that as the dierentiation rate u1;2(in this case) increases the originally
disadvantageous cancer stem cell becomes advantageous, Fig. 10(bottom).
Condition under which the cancer stem cells (in presence of a nite dieren-
tiation rate ( u1;2), dedierentiation rate ( q) and relative proliferation ( r2=r1))
are advantageous or not, is a nontrivial question. As can be seen from the xed-
point analysis, the two xed points corresponding to a full xation of mutant cell
(versus partial) in the nal population always exist. The condition for having
a successful mutant depends on when the mutant xed point becomes globally
attractive. We have calculated this numerically by diagonalizing the Jacobian
matrix of Eq. 9, and looking at the point when the second eigenvalue becomes
negative (one eigenvalue corresponding to x2direction is always attractive thus
we only need to look at the sign change of the other eigenvalue).This leads to a
phase diagram for successful and unsuccessful mutants as function of r=r2=r1
andq. Fig. 11 shows the results for two dierent values of dierentiation rates
u1;2= 0.3 (left) and u1;2= 0.7 (right). The higher dierentiation rate helps the
mutant to shift the neutral critical point (i.e. r= 1 forq= 0) faster to lower r
asqincreases. Fig. 12 shows a 3D plot of such a phase diagram as all the three
relevant parameters in the model change.

184. Discussion and Implications on Cancer Therapeutics
In this work we constructed a general model of stem cell selection dynamics
by including the population of dierentiated cells into a Moran-type model which
governs the stochastic dynamics of both stem cell and non-stem cell species at
the same time. Although the non-stem cell (dierentiated) population lacks
proliferative potential its population can increase through the dierentiation of
stem cells. Our model allows us to proceed with investigating the conditions for
having a successful mutant stem cell as a function of dierentiation probabilities
as well as the proliferation and death rates. Beside the competition between two
stem cells the model now can describe competition between stem cells and non-
stem cells which resemble itself as the fraction of the stem cells in the steady
state. The replicator dynamics that is derived for stem cell frequencies can
predict the average time to xation which is in agreement with previous known
results for the Moran model in the limit of no dierentiation.
The above construction allows us to approach theoretically the question of
dedierentiation and phenotypic plasticity that has been observed in recent ex-
periments and which is believed to be an important factor at the latest stages of
cancer. By including dedierentiation events into our replicator dynamics, we
are able to determine the fate of a cancer stem cell not only by its proliferation
potential but also based on the dedierentiation rate and overall dierentiation
parameters. We derive a 3D phase diagram that determines in what regions of
(proliferation, dedierentiation, dierentiation) space the cancer (mutant) stem
cell is successful. Interestingly, the phenotypic heterogeneity that is believed to
be a result of cell plasticity is seen in our model in the presence of dedieren-
tiation. Due to the plastic nature of dierentiated cells even a disadvantageous
mutant will not completely go extinct but rather keepsis preserved as a small
subpopulation in the nal population of the system and can co-exist with the
normal stem cell population.
Notice that due to the complicated nature of adapting hierarchal prolifera-
tion scheme of stem cells into constant-nite population model(s) of selection
dynamics, we have had to keep things simplied. Thus the population of the
dierentiated cells generated by either the cancer stem cells or normal stem
cells are both included in one compartment. The justication for this assump-
tion, is that in equilibrium there is a relatively large pool of dierentiated cells
that then due to their plasticity (at least a fraction of them) can be expected
to contribute to an inux of dierentiated cells that transform back into caner
stem cells. The lack of any experimental observations to distinguish between
plastic and non-plastic dierentiated cells has led us to keep the simplest model
possible. However, the reader should be cautious since for small populations
of dierentiated cells we might expect some distinction between a lineage of
dierentiated cells derived from cancer stem cells from one generated by normal
stem cells. This will be the subject of future work.
The implications of the cancer stem cell dynamics for cancer therapeutics
is also important. The evolutionary dynamics of drug resistance has been dis-
cussed in the literature in some detail (Iwasa et al, 2006) (see also (Dingli and
19Michor, 2006)(Foo and Michor, 2009)). The idea in previous modelling schemes
is that due to strong genetic heterogeneity of stem cells inside the tumour, there
is a nite probability of having a particular drug-resistant phenotype which upon
chemotherapy (or radiotherapy) can take over the system and replenish the can-
cer stem cell pool even faster than before. Inclusion of phenotypic plasticity,
as we discussed in this model, however, suggests an alternative picture. In this
picture tumour heterogeneity is due to diverse dedierentiation programs which
result in a set of plastic dierentiated cells transforming back into a variety
of cancer stem cell phenotypes. Thus even if the therapy kills all cancer stem
cells in the tumour, as long as a small population of plastic non-stem cells ex-
ist there is a nite chance for them to create a drug-resistant phenotype. Due
to a much higher rate of dedierentiation (relative to somatic mutations) this
alternative picture can explain the solidity of the drug-resistance mechanism in
many tumours. Our model also suggests that this rate strongly depends on the
number of dedierentiation channels developed in the tumour (which correlates
with the level of plasticity and aggressiveness of the tumour phenotypes). Drug
resistance due to dedierentiation also predicts a dependence of resistance on
the size of the tumour after the therapy. As a matter of fact when the tumour
is in its early stages, the dedierentiation rate is low, the heterogeneity is also
small, and thus therapy eradicates or reduces the size of the tumour signi-
cantly. However, if the drug-resistant colony is already formed and the main
mechanism of their population increase is due to their self-renewal capability,
then the cancer therapy might not work due to both increased rate of plasticity
and also inability to overcome the resistant colony.
There are also important implications related to the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), a cellular dierentiation program wherein epithelial cells
adopt mesenchymal features. It is known that cancer cells that undergone EMT
have less proliferation potential (division rate) (Gatenby and Gillies, 2008) but
much higher plasticity and dedierentiation than their progenitors. The phase
diagram derived in the previous section can answer the paradoxical situation
that even though EMT cells are assumed to be disadvantageous inside a tu-
mour they can undergo clonal expansion and defy extinction and eventually
pay a signicant role in the highly heterogenous population of the tumour.
