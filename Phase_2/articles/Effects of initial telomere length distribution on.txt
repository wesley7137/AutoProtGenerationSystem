Abstract. Replicative senescence, induced by telomere shortening, exhibits
considerable asynchrony and heterogeneity, the origins of which remain unclear.
Here, we formally study how telomere shortening mechanisms impact on senes-
cence kinetics and deﬁne two regimes of senescence, depending on the initial
telomere length variance. We provide analytical solutions to the model, high-
lighting a non-linear relationship between senescence onset and initial telomere
length distribution. This study reveals the complexity of the collective behavior
of telomeres as they shorten, leading to senescence heterogeneity.

Telomeres, the ends of eukaryote chromosomes, are poised in a dynamic equi-
librium controlled by two processes: limited telomere shortening at each cell
division and elongation by telomerase, a dedicated holoenzyme able to generate
de novo telomere sequence. When telomerase is not expressed, as in human
somatic cells, or is experimentally mutated in model organisms such as Sac-
charomyces cerevisiae [19], telomeres only shorten and after many divisions the
cell enters replicative senescence, a permanent cell cycle arrest induced by short
telomeres that elicit a DNA damage response. Replicative senescence is impli-
cated in organismal ageing and is a potent barrier to cancer emergence, but its
remarkable asynchrony and heterogeneity remain a challenge for investigating
the exact relationship between initial telomere length distribution and senes-
cence onset.
Telomere shortening is the unavoidable consequence of the end-replication prob-
lem [23, 36, 33]. In most examined species, telomeres end with a 5’ to3’ singled-
stranded DNA overhang (Fig. 1) [12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 26, 27, 37]. When the
replication fork reaches the end of the chromosome, the processing of the last
Okazaki fragment leaves a gap at the lagging strand, which recreates the single-
stranded overhang of the parental telomere (Fig. 1). On the leading strand,
after replication, complex maturation steps involving resection and ﬁll-in also
regenerate the overhang structure [17, 9, 7, 39, 33]. Regardless of these mat-
uration steps, the leading strand template for replication is shorter than the
lagging strand one, thus generating after replication two new telomeres of dif-
ferent lengths, one unchanged compared to the parental telomere and the other
shorter by exactly the length of the overhang, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Previous
mathematical models of telomere shortening also based on the end-replication
problem [18, 2, 22, 3] did not consider the maturation of the leading strand
telomere that generates a 3’-end overhang identical to the one on the lagging
strand. This maturation step is widely conserved throughout species with the
notable exception of angiosperm plants that display a blunt end at the leading
telomere [27]. We also note that other mathematical models examined higher
level structures such as t-loops [10, 29], or additional telomere states or break-
ing mechanisms [16, 31, 24, 25], such as damage due to oxidative stress [35].
InS. cerevisiae, however, oxidative stress does not signiﬁcantly alter telomere
length [30] and the end-replication problem is the main mechanism of telomere
shortening.
Consistently, on average, telomeres shorten at a constant rate of exactly half
of the overhang length per division. However, while studying the average is in-
formative of the global regulation and homeostasis of telomere length, it misses
important contributions of the asymmetry of telomere replication mechanism to
the overall telomere length distribution and to the heterogeneity of the onset of
senescence. Taking this asymmetry into account, the shortening of a telomere
in a cell lineage, deﬁned as a random succession of mitotically related cells [41],
is probabilistic and follows a Bernoulli process. Additionally, if the two ends of
a given chromosome are considered together, the 3’-end at one telomere belongs
2to the same DNA strand as the 5’-end on the other telomere of the same chro-
mosome, implying that the asymmetry at one telomere is inverted compared to
the other (Fig. 1). We deﬁne this relationship between the two ends of the same
chromosome as a coupling mechanism, which adds another layer of constraint
and will also be modeled here.
In this article, we study the consequences of the asymmetry and the coupling
on the distribution and the dynamics of telomere length in two distinct phases:
at steady state in the presence of telomerase and in a strictly shortening phase
without telomerase. We show that the robustness of telomerase recruitment
impacts on the variance of the steady-state distribution of telomere length. In
turn, this variance deﬁnes diﬀerent regimes of senescence. In a regime of low
initial variance, senescence onset cannot be linearly inferred from the average
telomere length or even the length of the shortest telomere and we provide
an asymptotic expansion to account for this phenomenon. In contrast, a high
variance implies a linear correlation between the initial shortest telomere and
senescence onset. We provide analytical solutions to the diﬀerent models we
describe and suggest applications for the inference of the initial telomere length
distribution from experimental measurements of senescence onset.
2 Telomeres evolving with telomerase
We ﬁrst describe the most general model, corresponding to a lineage of haploid
yeast cells dividing in the presence of active telomerase. The two telomeres of a
given chromosome at generation n, called (L1
n;L2
n), are coupled as deﬁned above
andthe 32telomeresofthecellshortenaccordingtoaBernoullirandomvariable
Bnof parameter 1=2: ifBn= 1, thenL1
nis shortened by anucleotides, whereas
L2
nis preserved, and conversely if Bn= 0. Telomerase adds new telomere
sequences preferentially to shorter telomeres [34, 6], behavior that we capture
by introducing Ci
n,i2f1;2g, Bernoulli random variables of parameter f(Li
n),
according to [40], where fhas the shape shown in Fig. 2 (a) and Li
nis the
length of the telomere at the extremity ibefore replication. The shape of f
is such that below a length threshold Ls, the Bernoulli random variable Ci
n
equals 1, that is telomerase is always active. For a telomere longer than Ls,
the probability of fCi
n= 1gdecreases to zero, meaning that the longer the
telomere, the less likely it is to be elongated by telomerase. Since the number
of nucleotides added by telomerase is independent of the length of the telomere
[34, 40], we introduce G1
nandG2
ntwo independent geometric random variables of
parameterp, independent of all the other quantities (including L1
n;L2
n), which
correspond to the number of nucleotides added by telomerase. As a result, for
any given chromosome the N2-valued process (L1
n;L2
n)follows:

eres end with a 3’ overhang of length a(measured to be 5 10nucleotides in yeast [33], chosen
here asa= 1or7for theoretical or numerical purposes, respectively). After DNA replica-
tion, each telomere generates, through either the leading or the lagging strand replication
machineries, two new telomeres of diﬀerent lengths. The coupling eﬀect between the two ends
of the same chromosome imposes that only one of the two is shortened while the other retains
the parental length.

To characterize the steady state of telomere length distribution, we focus on
one telomere—because as an approximation, telomeres of diﬀerent chromosomes
are assumed to be independent [32]—, and consider the projection of the ﬁrst
coordinateofachromosomeinordertocomputeitsequilibrium. Wewillanalyze
the coupling eﬀect in more depth in the second regime without telomerase. Our
model thus becomes:
Ln+1= (Ln aBn)++ CnGn (2)
whereLnis the length of a given telomere, Ln+1the length of one of the two
daughter telomeres, Gna geometric random variable of parameter p2(0;1). An
averaged version of this model has been studied in [40, 8] and used in [5], where
instead of being stochastic, telomere shortening was chosen to be deterministic
with a constant value of a=2. To make our computations fully explicit without
betraying the principles of the biological mechanism, instead of f, we consider
a sharp threshold at a value is(Fig. 2b). Our model becomes:
Ln+1= (Ln aBn)++Gn 1fLn6isg (3)
Independently of the value of is, the Markov chain (Ln)n>0deﬁned by (3)
has a unique equilibrium distribution L1and the generating function of L1is
characterized by the equality:

Appendix A gives a proof of this result and explains how to get a fully
explicit expression for the distribution L1from equation (4). This calculation
reveals how the parameters aandpaﬀect the steady-state distribution.
The choice of the value of isaccording to biological experiments is explained
in Appendix B. We ﬁnd that the variance of the steady-state telomere length
distribution obtained using the simpliﬁed model (3) is signiﬁcantly smaller than
the one with the complete model (2) (Fig. 2c in black and grey, respectively;
37bp as compared to 101bp), demonstrating that the residual recruitment of
telomerase to rather long telomeres strongly contributes to the spread of the
steady-state distribution of telomere length. In turn, the variance of this distri-
bution is critical for determining the onset of senescence and its heterogeneity,
as we show below. Thus, the mode of recruitment and activation of telomerase,
dependent on the biochemical properties of the holoenzyme and on its inter-
actions with telomeric proteins [38], controls key features of senescence once
telomerase is removed.

63 Telomeres evolving without telomerase
We then analyze the consequences of the steady-state distribution on the on-
set of senescence, meaning the number of generations undergone by a given
cell lineage until it enters senescence. We simply call it time of senescence,
denoted by T. One practical goal of this section is to derive the parameters
of the initial distribution from the time of senescence, which is useful for ex-
perimentalists. In senescing cells, telomerase is inactive and when the shortest
telomere reaches a threshold S, the cell enters replicative senescence and stops
dividing [1, 19, 13, 42, 4]. A haploid yeast cell has 16chromosomes and thus 32
telomeres. Mathematically, we consider the vector (L1
n;L2
n;:::;L32
n)of these 32
telomere lengths at generation n. Because each chromosome behaves indepen-
dently [32], we can start by studying one chromosome and the behavior of the
16will easily follow. More precisely, the vector (L1
n;L2
n;:::;L32
n)can be seen as
a family (Xi
n;Yi

representing the two telomeres of a chromosome, with (Xi

Normalizations. As telomeres can only shorten, we consider the shortening
length to be a= 1. For numerical estimations of the time of senescence, we will
divide our results by a= 7to obtain biologically relevant values. Moreover, we
can choose S= 0by simply translating the initial state by S. These assump-
tions are made in all following calculations unless stated otherwise.

SeeAppendixCfortheproof. Becauseofthediﬃcultytoinvertthisformula,
we choose to study separately the inﬂuence of the mean and the variance of the
initial state on the time of senescence. Thus, we ﬁrst consider a deterministic
and constant initial state X0=x0:
k= 1;:::; 32; Lk

7We deﬁneT1
x0as the ﬁrst time one of two coupled telomeres reaches zero
both starting from x0, andTx0as the time of senescence of the whole cell when
the initial state is constant and equals x0.

We then perform an asymptotic expansion of E(Tx0)for large values of x0,
which is numerically justiﬁed (Appendix B and Fig. 2c). At the ﬁrst order the

Inﬂuence of the initial variance on the time of senescence. Now, to
study only the inﬂuence of the initial variance, we consider that each initial
telomere is uniformly distributed in the interval [E(L1) ;E(L1) +]and
simulate the expected time of senescence as a function of (Fig. 3b). When 
8has large values, there is a higher probability that the initial shortest telomere
of (L1
0;:::;L32
0)is far from the mean E(L1)and, thus, that it remains the
shortest one until senescence. We therefore expect, for large enough value of 
(Fig. 3b), that the time of senescence is asymptotically equivalent to the time
when the initial shortest telomere reaches zero. As, on average, the number of
steps for a simple random walk starting from M=E

We indeed ﬁnd this asymptotic behavior by simulations (Fig. 3b), highlighting
two regimes that depend on the initial variance. If has a small value, which is
close to the deterministic initial state studied above (equation (10)), the time of
senescence is much smaller than expected by just considering the shortest telom-
ere because of the coupling eﬀect. If has a large value, the time of senescence
is mainly determined by the shortening of the initial shortest telomere.

and compared to numerical simulations ( 1000independent simulations).
Wenextaskwhichofthesetworegimescanbeobservedinsimulatedtimesof
senescence from the telomere distributions described in Fig. 2, which are biologi-
cally more relevant than the previous distribution models. To do so, we simulate
1000individual lineages of senescing cells and record their time of senescence,
starting by randomly drawing their 32 telomeres from the biologically relevant
distribution (large variance, in grey in Fig. 2c), from the simpliﬁed distribu-
tion (intermediate variance, in black in Fig. 2c) or from a constant distribution
(no variance) (Fig. 4). We then compare these simulated times of senescence
with those predicted either from the mean behavior of the shortest telomere
(equation (11), dashed black lines in Fig. 4) or the asymptotic expansion on the
mean of the initial distribution (equation (10), black lines in Fig. 4). The bio-
logically relevant distribution gives simulated times of senescence that are fully
predicted by computing the mean behavior of the average initial shortest telom-
ere (Fig. 4a, compare grey and dashed black lines which are superimposed).
9In contrast, the constant distribution leads to a senescence onset dictated by
the asymptotic expansion (Fig. 4c, compare grey and black lines), consistent
with the results in Fig. 3a. The simpliﬁed distribution produces an intermedi-
ate result where the mean behavior of the shortest telomere and the asymptotic
expansion lead to similar predictions, which lay close to the simulated times of
senescence (Fig. 4b, compare grey, black and dashed black lines). These results
show that deﬁning two senescence regimes depending on the initial variance of
telomere length distribution is critical for understanding the relevant dynamics
of telomere shortening leading to senescence.

4 Conclusion
In summary, in this article, we isolated all the sources of ﬂuctuations of the
time of senescence that are dependent on telomere length. To do so, we mod-
eled several molecular mechanisms that contribute at various levels to telomere
length distribution and dynamics in S. cerevisiae , where they are the most ex-
haustively and quantitatively described. Among these mechanisms, we found
that the asymmetry of telomere replication and the coupling between the two
telomeres belonging to the same chromosome signiﬁcantly contribute to senes-
cenceheterogeneityandweformallyestablishedtheirlinks. Wealsoshowedthat
the mode and robustness of telomerase recruitment control the variance of the
steady-state telomere length distribution, which in turn deﬁnes two senescence
regimes. With a low initial variance, the time of senescence is non-linearly
related to the initial mean telomere length. In contrast, a high initial vari-
ance leads to a major role of the initial shortest telomere in controlling senes-
cence. Because natural telomere length distributions can vary considerabely,
even within a species, we suggest that depending on the initial variance, the
two regimes we describe may operate at the same time during senescence. As
10the core mechanisms modelled here are conserved in most eukaryotes, we ex-
pect that our conclusions should also, in principle, apply to telomere-dependent
senescence in human cells, although additional factors and mechanisms also
contribute to senescence heterogeneity [10, 29, 24]. This work uncovers a new
layer of complexity in the relationship between senescence onset and telomere
shortening explained by the asymmetry and coupling mechanisms, and proposes
methods for assessing the time of senescence or conversely inferring parameters
of the initial telomere length distribution.

A Steady state of telomeres evolving with telom-
erase
First, we prove that both Markov chains deﬁned by (2), (3) are ergodic and,
second, we derive formula (4). The ergodicity is a direct consequence of Foster-
Lyapunov criteria (Corollary 8.7 p. 214 in [28] or Proposition 1.3 in [11], for
instance). The chains are time-homogeneous and, for L0>a:
E(L1 L0) =E( aB0+ C 0G0) = a=2 +f(L0)E(G0);
and this last quantity is negative for large enough values of L0becauseftends
to zero, either fisf(l) = (1 +(l Ls)) 1orf(l) = 1l6is. This proof of
ergodicity works for any function fhaving a limit lat inﬁnity which satisﬁes
l<a
2E(G0).
Moreover, the Markov chains (Ln)deﬁned by (2), (3) are irreducible and
aperiodic. Therefore, in both cases, there exists a unique equilibrium distribu-
tion, denoted L1. For the model (3), it is characterized by the fact that L1
and(L1 aB0)++G0 1fL16isghave the same probability generating function.

The following table gives the recurrence relations obtained after identiﬁca-
tion in the coeﬃcients of (A.2).

Note that for ksuch that 06k6a 1, the identiﬁcation gives no infor-
mation on the values of the k. These formulas show that all the kdepend
linearly on the aﬁrst states, k,k= 0;:::;a 1. Now, we indicate how to
compute these aﬁrst values.
Hence, using (4), the generating function of L1is only a function of the a
ﬁrst states. Dividing (4) by (1 u)(1 uq), we can ﬁnd  :Ra[0;1]!R
linear in the ﬁrst acoordinates such that:
(1 ++ua 1)E(uL1) = (0;:::;a 1;u): (A.3)
Thea 1rootsofR(u) = 1++ua 1aretheuk=e2ik=afor16k6a 1,
which are in the unit disk. Therefore, the vector (0;:::;a 1)is solution of
the system:
 (0;:::;a 1;uk) = 0for16k6a 1 (A.4)
where0is, as usual determined, by the normalization condition. If the a
asystem (A.4) to which we added the normalization condition is invertible, then
13there exists a unique solution (0;:::;a 1). Having the vector (0;:::;a 1),
the generating function E(L1)follows from (A.3).
Finally, we want to explicitly determine the kfork>a.The previous table
gives homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coeﬃcients. For
instancek, forkinJa+ 1;isK, is a linear combination (independant of k) of
thek-th powers of the roots of the (conjugate of the) characteristic polynomial
cXa+1 (1 +c)Xa+ 1, wherec= 2q=p2(0;1). This polynomial is of degree
a+ 1and has 1as a root. This last property is also true for the characteristic
polynomials of the relations for the kforkinJis+ 2;is+aKor>is+a+ 1.
As the quartic equation has explicit solutions, the expressions of the k,k>a
are fully explicit if a+ 164 + 1, that isa64. In particular for a= 1, the
(k)k2J1;isKand(k)k>isare two geometric progressions:

Fora>4the roots of these polynomials can be found numerically.
B Choice of is
To rigorously compare the variance of the simpliﬁed model (3) with the one
of (2), we choose isso that the ceiling function of the mean of the equilibrium
of (3)dE(L1)eis the same as the one for (2), i.e.342bp in [40]. We take the
biological parameters obtained in [34, 33] and used in [40]:
a= 7; p= 0:026; Ls= 90; = 0:045;
whereis a ﬁtting parameter describing telomerase recruitment to telom-
eres [40] (Table E.1). In order to compute the corresponding mean of the equi-
librium, for each choice of iswe run 106numerical simulations of (3). This
mean is then computed and plotted as a function of is,cf.Fig. B.1. Finally,
we chose the value of isthat givesdE(L1)e= 342bp. This procedure leads to
is= 308bp.
C Expected Time of Senescence
The aim of this section is to establish formula (5). Before entering the details
just note that taking a= 1is not strictly equivalent to make a change in the
length unit as the lenghts of the telomeres are integer-valued. But taking a>1
only make the results more diﬃcult to state without exhibiting a new behaviour.
For the sake of simplicity, we drop the superscript iin this section and start by
studying a typical couple (Xn;Yn). The shortening of these two telomeres can
be mathematically translated into the following model:
Xn+1
Yn+1
=(Xn aBn)+
(Yn a(1 Bn))+

This process is an oriented simple random walk on Z2until one of the coor-
dinates reaches zero, and can be written explicitly:
Xn=X0 anX
k=1Bk=X0 aB(n;1=2);
Yn=Y0 anX
k=1(1 Bk) =Y0 a(n B(n;1=2));(C.7)
where B(n;1=2)is a binomial distribution of parameters nand1=2. In this case,
let us deﬁne the ﬁrst time one of the coordinates reaches zero, T1, as:
T1= inffn>0;min(Xn;Yn)<0g
Then, from (C.7) and for a= 1, because (Xn)and(Yn)are non-increasing, we
get:
P(T1>n) =P(Xn>0;Yn>0) =P(n Y06B(n;1=2)6X0)

From here, we easily derive the distribution of the time of senescence by con-
15sidering all 16independent pairs of telomeres:

=P(min(Xn;Yn)>0)16=P(T1>n)16:(C.9)
Formulas (C.8) and (C.9) lead to (5), which gives the expected time of
senescence (6) using E(T) =P1
n=0P(T >n ).
D Asymptotics of the Mean Time of Senescence
The aim of this section is to prove formulas (9) and (10). To do so we ﬁrst
note that, using a generalized version of the central limit theorem, for any ﬁxed
positive number t, and any sequence untn:
