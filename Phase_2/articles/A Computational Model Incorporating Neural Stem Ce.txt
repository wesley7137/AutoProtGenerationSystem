glioma, we have incorporated empirically-determined estimates of neural stem
cell number, cell division rate, mutation rate and oncogenic potential into our
model. We demonstrate that our model yields results which match actual
demographic data in the human population. In particular, this model accounts
for the observed peak incidence of glioma at approximately 80 years of age,
without the need to assert differential susceptibility throughout the
population. Overall, our model supports the hypothesis that glioma is caused by
randomly-occurring oncogenic mutations within the neural stem cell population.
Based on this model, we assess the influence of the (experimentally indicated)
decrease in the number of neural stem cells and increase of cell division rate
during aging. Our model provides multiple testable predictions, and suggests
that different temporal sequences of oncogenic mutations can lead to
tumorigenesis. Finally, we conclude that four or five oncogenic mutations are
sufficient for the formation of glioma.

Abstract
Glioma is the most common form of primary brain tumor. Demographically, the risk of occurrence
increases until old age. Here we present a novel computational model to reproduce the probability of
glioma incidence across the lifespan. Previous mathematical models explaining glioma incidence are
framed in a rather abstract way, and do not directly relate to empirical ndings. To decrease this gap
between theory and experimental observations, we incorporate recent data on cellular and molecular
factors underlying gliomagenesis. Since evidence implicates the adult neural stem cell as the likely cell-
of-origin of glioma, we have incorporated empirically-determined estimates of neural stem cell number,
cell division rate, mutation rate and oncogenic potential into our model. We demonstrate that our
model yields results which match actual demographic data in the human population. In particular, this
model accounts for the observed peak incidence of glioma at approximately 80 years of age, without
the need to assert dierential susceptibility throughout the population. Overall, our model supports the
hypothesis that glioma is caused by randomly-occurring oncogenic mutations within the neural stem cell
population. Based on this model, we assess the inuence of the (experimentally indicated) decrease in the
number of neural stem cells and increase of cell division rate during aging. Our model provides multiple
testable predictions, and suggests that dierent temporal sequences of oncogenic mutations can lead to
tumorigenesis. Finally, we conclude that four or ve oncogenic mutations are sucient for the formation
of glioma.
Introduction
Glioma is the most common form of primary brain tumor [1]. Glioma commonly manifests itself as a high-
grade tumor called glioblastoma, a highly malignant and invasive tumor with median patient survival of
12 months from diagnosis; lower-grade gliomas increase in malignancy over time, with associated increases
in mortality [2].
The cellular mechanisms giving rise to glioma are subject to intense research. The incidence of glioma
is not signicantly aected by environmental factors such as UV light and carcinogen exposure, due to
the protective inuence of the thick skull and the blood-brain barrier. In addition, there are no known
heritable factors in the risk of glioma occurrence. These tumors appear to arise idiopathically in a random
manner throughout the population [3]. Hence, glioma formation is an ideal test-case for investigating
how fundamental mechanisms on the single-cell level give rise to cancer.
Increasing age is strongly associated with higher incidence and increased malignant grade for all
grades and types of glioma [4,5]. Age is in fact the single most robust factor inuencing glioma incidence,
malignancy, and patient survival [1, 2, 4]. Insights into changes that occur in the aging brain and the
cells that originate the tumor are therefore essential for understanding this increased risk of oncogenic
transformation and tumorigenesis.arXiv:1503.06159v1  [q-bio.CB]  20 Mar 20152
The putative cell-of-origin of glioma is the neural stem cell (NSC), which normally gives rise to new
neurons and glial cells in the adult brain. Experimentally causing oncogenic mutations in this lineage leads
to the formation of malignant tumors [6{8], and gliomas cluster near germinal centers of the brain [9].
Proliferative cells within the tumor share immunomarkers with NSCs [10, 11]. NSCs already exist in
a proliferative state, are capable of dierentiating into glial cell types, and can migrate through tissue
[12,13]. Transplantation of oncogenically-transformed mouse neural stem cells into syngeneic mice reliably
leads to the formation of a tumor which recapitulates the proliferative and invasive phenotype of human
glioma [14,15]. Together, these studies strongly implicate the neural stem cell as the most likely cell-of-
origin of glioma. In this report we show that modeling the accumulation of random mutations during
cell division in this stem cell population can predict glioma incidence across the lifespan in the human
population. In particular, we propose a model that accounts for dierential weightage and temporal
ordering of oncogenic mutations.
Materials and Methods
The model includes empirical data collected through literature review. The mutation frequency was
taken directly from a published estimate and assumed to be constant across the lifespan [16]. A small
subset of mutations were deemed to have oncogenic potential in this cellular compartment while all other
mutations are assumed to be neutral for this cancer type [17]. In this approach, we used the Poisson-
approximation of a binomial distribution for computing the probabilities to have x oncogenic mutations.
First we compute the expected number of genetic mutations a cell has had at a certain age, and based
on that then compute the probability of having x oncogenic mutations. The mutation rate is therefore
independent of whether or not the gene is oncogenic.
The exponentially decreasing number of neural stem cells was calculated across the lifespan based
on the published data for human tissue [18]. Results of electron microscopy-based characterization is
shown in Figure 3 of [18], which used 200 micron thick sections. Results of immunohistochemistry-based
characterization are shown in Figure 1 of [18], which used 30 micron thick sections. These data are in
agreement - 144 cells per 200 micron-thick section (averaging the two locations described above) and
22 DCX+ cells per mm2in a 30 micron-thick section (estimated from the graph in Figure 1r of [18]).
These data both yield approximately 720 DCX+ cells per mm3. To estimate KI67+ proliferative cells,
not DCX+ cells, we multiplied the values for KI67+ cells from the relevant graph (Figure 1s of [18]) by
33, just as we multiplied the values for the DCX+ cells from the other graph (Figure 1r of [18]) by 33.
This provides values per mm3. In agreement with the data presented in Figures 1 and 3 of [18], their
Figure 2c shows that the tract is 1mm x 1mm wide. It is also 10 mm long (the scale bar represents 500
microns). So the number of KI67+ cells per mm3is multiplied again by 10 to estimate the total number
of KI67+ cells. The graph of KI67+ cells at each time point was then extrapolated to estimate this
population across the entire lifespan. Overall, we computed the number of NSCs at birth to be 237 600,
which was used as the initial value of the modeled number of NSCs during aging ( N0).
The cell division rate was calculated in NSCs derived from the young adult and aged adult mouse
brain [13]. The number of cell divisions in a given time was calculated from live-cell time-lapse imaging
over a 48 hour period. Actively-cycling young adult NSCs divided 1.37 times in 48 hours while actively-
cycling aged adult NSCs divided 1.74 times in 48 hours. Adjusted for time, actively-cycling young adult
NSCs divide 251 times per year while actively-cycling aged adult NSCs divide 318 times per year. For
the estimate that is incorporated in the model, we have used a linear interpolation between these two
numbers across the human lifespan. These estimates were assumed relevant for the population of NSCs
in the adult human brain (Fig. 1).
The model was implemented in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc.). A time step dt of 0.001 years was used
for calculating the prevalence. The computation of the incidence was done by computing the numerical
dierential of the prevalence over time. Bootstrapping was used to compute the 95 % condence interval3
of the incidence, as shown in Fig. S1. 1000 bootstrap samples of size 100 000 were computed.
Two of the model parameters ( ddescribing exponential decrease of NSCs with time and sincluded
in Eq. 5) were not assessed from experimental ndings. Depending on r(t) andkmin, dierent incidence
curves are obtained (i.e. the absolute values and the position of the curve peak were dierent). We have
adaptedsanddfor the dierent scenarios, in order for the incidence curve to match with the demographic
data [1]. A match could only be obtained for kmin>= 4. In Fig. 2, s= 1 andd= 0:1067 were used
for the incidence curve based on kmin= 3, while for kmin= 4 we used s= 10 andd= 0:028. For the
simulations using kmin= 5 andkmin= 6 we set s= 7500,d= 0:038 ands= 10 000 000, d= 0:0497,
respectively.
Results
To create our model, we included empirical data representing age-related changes in neural stem cell
number and behavior. A population of neural stem cells is present in the human brain at birth but declines
exponentially thereafter [18]. Experiments in rodents demonstrate that the exponential decline in neural
stem cell number continues across the lifespan [13,19]. This depletion of the stem cell population is due
to cell death and terminal dierentiation. We have therefore approximated the size of this cell population
(N(t)) with an exponential interpolation of the data from the human brain. Further experiments have
demonstrated that the remaining population of NSCs in the aged brain have dysregulated cell cycle
kinetics [13]. Individual remaining stem cells have an increased likelihood of re-entering the cell cycle,
resulting in an increased number of cell divisions in a given period of time ( r(t)). We have approximated
this behavior using a linear interpolation. Our model incorporates these empirically-determined changes
in neural stem cell number and behavior (Fig. 1).
NSCs accumulate mutations in every cell cycle. The process of genome replication during cell division
is imperfect, as a certain number of mutations occur and some of these mutations will remain unrepaired.
The number of mutations incurred during a single cell division has been estimated [16]. According to
their assessment, we denote by = 10e 7 the probability for a gene in the coding region to mutate
due to a single cell division. No single mutation leads to oncogenesis, so multiple hits are necessary for
complete oncogenic transformation [20, 21]. Cancer is characterized by a number of cellular changes,
including loss of cell cycle control, self-suciency in growth factor signaling, resistance to anti-growth
signals, escape from apoptosis, invasion and neovascularization [22]. When Hanahan and Weinberg rst
described these hallmarks of cancer, they proposed that approximately six mutations would be required
to dysregulate all six of these cellular activities [22]. Yet now researchers appreciate that mutation of a
single multi-functional protein can predispose alterations to multiple cellular activities [14,23]. Since the
cell is dependent upon semi-redundant regulatory pathways to control cell cycle progression and other
activities [20], loss of one major tumor suppressor is not sucient to create a tumor [21] and multiple
regulators must be disrupted to achieve oncogenic transformation [14,24]. Of the 18 440 ( ntotal) protein-
encoding genes in the human, 522 have a causal role in human cancer and nglioma = 29 of these (Table
S1) have a demonstrated role in promoting gliomagenesis [17]. We assessed how many mutations in this
set of oncogenes are required to achieve tumor formation. Based on this minimum number of mutations
(kmin), our model computes the total probability for a single NSC to become oncogenically transformed.
This integrative probability is calculated by summing up the individual probabilities according to the
following equation:
p(t) =29X
i=kminpi(t); (1)
wherepi(t) denotes the probability for ioncogenic mutations to have occurred at time t. We have
estimatedpi(t) using the experimentally assessed parameters N(t),r(t) and. Based on the number4
of protein-coding and gliomagenesis-relevant genes, the probability for any one of the 29 oncogenes to
become mutated from cell division is given by ponc=nglioma . Assuming that any gene mutates
with equal probability, the occurrence of oncogenic mutations can be approximated by the binomial
distribution. It follows that pi(t) is given by:
pi(t) =R(t)
i
pi
onc(1 ponc)R(t) i; (2)
whereR(t) is the number of cell divisions a NSC has undergone until time t. It is computed by integrating
the cell division rate r(t) across the age span until time t.
Given that R(t) andponctake suciently high ( >100) and low ( <0:0001) values respectively, the
Poisson distribution is well-suited as an approximation for this otherwise computationally very demanding
formula:
pi(t) =i
i!e ; (3)
with(t) =R(t)ponc. The temporal sequence of oncogene mutations has been shown to be an important
factor in tumor formation [25, 26], and so we have also accounted for it in our model. Given that there
arei! possibilities for imutations to occur, Eq. 3 becomes:
pi(t) =s
i!i
i!e ; (4)
where the scalar value srepresents the number of specic mutational sequences necessary for oncogenic
transformation. For kmin= 5, we nd s= 7500 to be an appropriate value in order for the incidence
curve to be in numerical accordance with the demographic data (Fig. 2). This means that on average
7500 dierent sequences of mutations exist (for the dierent scenarios, i.e. 5, 6, ..., 29 oncogenes aected),
which can ultimately lead to oncogenic transformation.
The probability for a single cell to become oncogenically transformed is denoted by p(t). Accordingly,
the probability for glioma formation overall is proportional to the probability that at least one of all the
NSC becomes transformed:
pglioma (t) = 1 (1 p(t))N(t); (5)
whereN(t) =N0e dtis the estimated number of NSCs at time t. Hence, the parameter ddescribes
the decay of the NSC population over time, and so is in principle directly relatable to empirical data.
We have adapted dsuch that the resulting incidence curve matches the demographic data, while being
qualitatively in accordance with experimental ndings in the mouse [13,19].
The prevalence of glioma is then proportional to pglioma (t). Since the units from the demographic
datasets are with respect to 100 000 person-years, we compute the prevalence by multiplying pglioma (t)
by 100 000. From this, the incidence is computed by calculating the derivative. Since there are various
time-varying parameters in the model, an analytical dierentiation comprises a too extensive formula.
We therefore assess the incidence numerically. The obtained incidence curve is shown in Fig. 2 and
resembles the demographic data.
The actual incidence of glioma across age demographics has been documented by The Central Brain
Tumor Registry of the United States [1]. We have used these published data to provide a t for the
incidence and prevalence of glioma across the lifespan (Fig. 2). The model parameters sanddwere5
adapted in order to match with these incidence rates. The incidence curves obtained from our model
forkmin= 4,kmin= 5 orkmin= 6 resemble these demographic data. Also for kmin>6 is it possible
to achieve agreement, and so our model yields a lower bound for the number of mutations required for
oncogenic transformation. However, with increasing kminthe model parameters sanddneed to change
too. In particular, the parameter sstrongly increases. For kmin= 4,kmin= 5 andkmin= 6 we nd
s= 10,s= 7500 and s= 10 000 000 to be well-suited, respectively.
The biological meaning of parameter sin Eq. 4 is twofold. It captures that dierent oncogenes can
yield the same transformation hallmarks [6,24], and so multiple sequences of the same length could give
rise to glioma. Additionally, saccounts for the possibility that dierent temporal sequences of the same
oncogenes could lead to glioma formation. In the classical multistage model, there is only one temporal
order that can achieve transformation. Importantly, since sdenotes an average number of mutations, it
could be dierent for dierent sequence lengths i. With increasing i,sican grow exponentially because
of the factorials in the denominator of Eq. 4. For simplication and due to lack of detailed empirical
knowledge, we chose to use the same sfor all sequence lengths.
Since no studies in the human have directly demonstrated increased cell division in NSCs, we have
created a related model that assumes no age-related changes in cell division rate, cell cycle length or
likelihood to re-enter cell cycle. This adjusted model yields the same results in glioma incidence and
required mutation number if the exponential decrease in proliferative cell number is adjusted accordingly
(Fig. 3A). This age-related change is therefore not a necessary condition of the model. Future labelling
studies of the proliferative cell population in the human brain will help to evaluate the relative accuracy
of these two models. Interestingly, the model quanties the net eect of an increasing cell division rate
while the other parameters are the same (Fig. 3CD). These results suggest that this increase of cell
division rate almost doubles the occurrence of glioma.
Discussion
Mathematical modeling has been used to create predictions regarding the growth of tumors [27,28] and
response of individual tumors to surgical resection or radiotherapy [29, 30]. The incidence of tumors
in a human population has also been modeled [31, 32]. However these models of cancer incidence did
not employ empirical measures of age-related changes in cellular dynamics, nor did they incorporate
experimental knowledge on glioma-related proto-oncogenes. Here we present a model to predict the
probability of glioma incidence across the lifespan based on neural stem cell dynamics in the individual
organism.
We nd that a simple model using recent estimates of biological parameters on the single-cell level can
account for demographic observations. Along these lines, we provide a modied and extended version of
the well-established Armitage-Doll model [31]. In contrast to this classical approach, we do not restrict our
model to a specic number of oncogenic mutations. Instead, we account for all the numbers of oncogenic
mutations that possibly can occur (i.e. mutations of kminto 29 oncogenes, see Eq. 1). Our model
therefore does not rely on the (experimentally unsupported) assumption of the classical Armitage-Doll
model that only a specic number of oncogenes must be mutated for oncogenic transformation.
Since the parameters of our model have a direct biological meaning, further biological data can be
incorporated and predictions can be made. For example, previous theories have yielded various estimates
for the minimal number of oncogenic mutations required for carcinogenesis [33{35]. Notably, we come to
the conclusion that a minimum of 4 or 5 oncogenic mutations is sucient for tumorigenesis, in contrast
to 6-7 mutations as implicated by the classical Armitage-Doll model [31] and as predicted by Hanahan
and Weinberg [22]. kmin= 5 is higher than experimental results which demonstrate that NSCs can
be oncogenically transformed successfully with only three oncogenic mutations specically aecting the
PTEN, p53 and Rb pathways [14,24,36]. However, many human gliomas regardless of grade demonstrate
5 mutations, namely aecting EGFR, PTEN, P16INK 4A, TP53 and MDM2 [3]. Therefore our model is6
in line with empirical studies on the number of mutations required to achieve oncogenic transformation.
Many mutations aecting tumor suppressor pathways will cause a cell to undergo senescence, slowing the
cell division rate and increasing the likelihood of apoptosis. Very few sequences of mutation are likely to
bypass this protective response. So it is easy to imagine that few scenarios ( s= 10) are compatible with a
low number of mutations achieving oncogenic transformation ( kmin= 4), while more scenarios ( s= 7500)
can achieve oncogenic transformation with a larger number of mutations ( kmin= 5). Considering that
dierent oncogenic mutations yield the same hallmark, and that multiple temporal sequences of the same
mutations could yield the same result, we nd s= 7500 more plausible than s= 10. This model therefore
supports the conclusion that ve oncogenic mutations are sucient to achieve oncogenic transformation
and initiate gliomagenesis.
Our model accounts for the possibility that some oncogenes, due to more interactions, play a more
central role than others [37]. Therefore, fewer mutations of such hub genes might be sucient for the
formation of glioma. It is possible that altered function of such hub genes could lead to genomic instability
and increased mutation rate. However, one assumption in our model is the stable accumulation of
mutations in every cell cycle. While this number of mutations have been estimated in proliferative cell
types [16], this rate may indeed depend on prior changes. With age, the genome becomes more unstable
due to shortened telomeres, increased mutation load and chromosomal abnormalities [38]. All of these
changes could increase the likelihood of mutations or disrupt the ecacy of repair mechanisms. The
net mutations incurred during each division may therefore increase with age. However any age-related
changes to the mutation rate depending on prior mutation load have not been empirically determined so
we were unable to incorporate this age-related factor into our calculations. We have therefore estimated
that the mutation rate remains constant across the lifespan.
However our model does allow us to incorporate dierent weightage for mutations, i.e. that some
mutations are less likely to co-exist than others, as has been established by the Cancer Genome Atlas
eort ( http://cancergenome.nih.gov/ ) [21,25]. In Eq. 4 the denominator increases much faster than
the nominator with the length of the modeled sequence of oncogenes, and so long sequences are unlikely
to occur. Hence, mutational combinations that are included only in the long sequences are unlikely to
co-exist overall.
In light of evidence that a temporal sequence of mutations may be crucial in tumorigenesis [25,26], it
is notable that our model considers variation in the number and order of oncogenic mutations needed to
invoke glioma formation. Our model thus usefully explores the relationship between these experimentally
tractable variables, particularly kmin,d,s,N(t) andr(t).
Similar to previous researchers [32], we have included an age-related decline in the number of prolif-
erative cells, which is responsible for the characteristic peak of the incidence at 80 years. In contrast to
their linear decrease, we model an exponential decrease of the proliferative pool which matches better
with experimental ndings in this cell population [13,18,19]. In addition, we employ empirically-derived
results to estimate cell cycle length [12], the mutation rate during each cell cycle [16] and the fraction of
genes that promote oncogenic transformation upon mutation ( [17] and Table S1). Together, these data
can be used to predict the age-associated incidence of glioma in the human population [1] without the
need to assert dierential susceptibility throughout the population which is not supported by biological
evidence [39].
It is possible that other cell types besides the neural stem cell give rise to glioma. One recent study
demonstrated that mature cells such as neurons can be forced to undergo oncogenic transformation using
cell-specic targeting of two major tumor suppressor pathways [36], however it is not clear that such
mutations could randomly occur in a post-mitotic cell population. Alternatively, glial progenitor cells
within the white matter have been proposed to be the true glioma cell-of-origin [40,41]. Empirical data
on these cells are scarcer, so we are currently unable to estimate the size of this population and the rate
of glial progenitor cell division across the lifespan (key variables for implementing this model). Future
studies may help to address whether the cell cycle kinetics of this population can also predict actual7
glioma incidence in the human population. Variability in the cellular origin as well as the underlying
genetic lesions of glioma could in part explain the extraordinary heterogeneity in this tumor type. Yet
the evidence most strongly implicates the multi-potent neural stem cell as the most likely cell of origin,
so we have focused on this cell type in our model.
There is evidence to suggest the molecular pathogenesis of high-grade gliomas (presenting as primary
glioblastoma) is dierent to that of low-grade gliomas (presenting as grade II-III astrocytoma or oligoden-
droglioma, often progressing to secondary glioblastoma). These two types of brain tumor have dierent
genetic and epigenetic proles, with dierent initiating mutations [42]. In the future, this model could
be adapted to include such dierent constraints on molecular pathogenesis to distinguish between the
incidence rates of low-grade and high-grade glioma.
Overall, we provide a model that uses experimentally obtained parameters on neural stem cell pro-
liferation and yields results which match with actual demographic data in the human population. We
demonstrate the consistency of our model which incorporates estimates of neural stem cell number, cell
division rate, mutation rate and number of oncogenes. Importantly, our model supports the hypothesis
that glioma is caused by randomly occurring oncogenic mutations within the neural stem cell population
of the adult brain.

Figure 3. Eect of increasing cell division rate. (A) Modeled incidence of glioma (green) under
constant cell division rate ( r(t) = 251divisions
year). Model parameters kmin= 5,s= 8800 and d= 0:0333
were used in order to match with the demographic data (red crosses: mean incidence of age groups, red
lines: spans of age groups). The increasing proliferation rate of NSCs is therefore not a necessary
condition for the incidence curve to match the demographic data, since similar results are obtained after
changes in the model parameters sandd.(B)Number of NSCs over time, as used for the incidence
curve shown in (A) (black) and for the scenario where cell division rate increases linearly (Fig. 2, blue).
Small changes in the number of NSCs over time are sucient to make up for the constant cell division
rate. It remains an empirical question which estimates of N(t) andr(t) are correct in the adult human,
since these are extrapolated from the model, the young human, and the aging rodent. (C)Incidence of
glioma as derived from our model, for increasing (blue) and constant (green) cell division rate during
aging. Model parameters are the same ( kmin= 5,s= 7500,d= 0:038). The green curve is the predicted
incidence by the model if the proliferation rate was constant, and so leads an estimate of the net eect
of the increase. Overall, our model suggests that the increase in cell-cycle re-entry substantially
increases glioma formation. (D) Prevalence of glioma for increasing (blue) and constant (green) cell
division rate. As shown in Suppl. Fig. S2, the results are qualitatively conrmed also for kmin= 4.14

Table S1: Proto-oncogenes implicated in glioma formation. Information on the 29
proto-oncogenes that have been implicated in the formation of glioma. The COSMIC Cancer Gene
Census is a regularly-updated catalogue of somatic cell mutations causally implicated in cancer:
http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/census . Of all genes listed, we have selected genes with a
known role in glioma (including subtypes such as glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma). An
additional 6 genes were listed in the COSMIC gene database as being implicated in \other tumor
types". These genes, KRAS, MYC, CDKN2A(p16), CDKN2A(p14), CTNNB1(beta-catenin), and
ERBB2(HER2), have indeed been implicated in gliomagenesis in other studies [43{46], so we have
included them in this list. The probability of any one of the oncogenes being mutated is equivalent to
ponc=nglioma , wherenglioma is the number of oncogenes involved in glioma formation and is the
probability for genetic mutation due to a single cell division.
